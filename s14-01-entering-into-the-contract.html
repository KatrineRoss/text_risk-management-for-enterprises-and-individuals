        <p class="para" id="baranoff-ch10_s01_p01">In this section we elaborate on the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="baranoff-ch10_s01_l01">
            <li>The preliminary steps of entering into an insurance contract</li>
            <li>The roles assumed by applications and binders in the offer and acceptance process</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch10_s01_p02">You may recall from <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch09#baranoff-ch09">Chapter 9 "Fundamental Doctrines Affecting Insurance Contracts"</a> that every contract requires an offer and an acceptance. This is also true for insurance. The offer and acceptance occur through the application process.</p>
    <div class="section" id="baranoff-ch10_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Applications</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch10_s01_s01_p01">Although more insurance is sold rather than bought, the insured is still required to make an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">application</a><span class="glossdef">An offer to buy insurance</span></span>, which is an offer to buy insurance. The function of the agent is to induce a potential insured to make an offer. As a practical matter, the agent also fills out the application and then asks for a signature after careful study of the application. The application identifies the insured in more or less detail, depending on the type of insurance. It also provides information about the exposure involved.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch10_s01_s01_p02">For example, in an application for an automobile policy, you would identify yourself; describe the automobile to be insured; and indicate the use of the automobile, where it will be garaged, who will drive it, and other facts that help the insurer assess the degree of risk you represent as a policyholder. Some applications for automobile insurance also require considerable information about your driving and claim experience, as well as information about others who may use the car. In many cases, such as life insurance, the written application becomes part of the policy. Occasionally, before an oral or written property/casualty application is processed into a policy, a temporary contract, or binder, may be issued.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="baranoff-ch10_s01_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Binders</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch10_s01_s02_p01">As discussed in <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch09#baranoff-ch09">Chapter 9 "Fundamental Doctrines Affecting Insurance Contracts"</a>, property/casualty insurance coverage may be provided while the application is being processed. This is done through the use of a binder, which is a temporary contract to provide coverage until the policy is issued by the agent or the company.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch10_s01_s02_p02">In property/casualty insurance, an agent who has binding authority can create a contract between the insurance company and the insured. Two factors influence the granting of such authority. First, some companies prefer to have underwriting decisions made by specialists in the underwriting department, so they do not grant binding authority to the agent. Second, some policies are cancelable; others are not. The underwriting errors of an agent with binding authority may be corrected by cancellation if the policy is cancelable. Even with cancelable policies, the insurer is responsible under a binder for losses that occur prior to cancellation. If it is not cancelable, the insurer is obligated for the term of the contract.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch10_s01_s02_p03">The binder may be written or oral. For example, if you telephone an agent and ask to have your house insured, the agent will ask for the necessary information, give a brief statement about the contract—the coverage and the premium cost—and then probably say, “You are covered.” At this point, you have made an oral application and the agent has accepted your offer by creating an oral binder. The agent may mail or e-mail a written binder to you to serve as evidence of the contract until the policy is received. The written binder shows who is insured, for what perils, the amount of the insurance, and the company with which coverage is placed.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch10_s01_s02_p04">In most states, an oral binder is as legal as a written one, but in case of a dispute it may be difficult to prove its terms. Suppose your house burns after the oral binder has been made but before the policy has been issued, and the agent denies the existence of the contract. How can you prove there was a contract? Or suppose the agent orally binds the coverage, a fire occurs, and the agent dies before the policy is issued. Unless there is evidence in writing, how can you prove the existence of a contract? Suppose the agent does not die and does not deny the existence of the contract, but has no evidence in writing. If the agent represents only one company, he or she may assert that the company was bound and the insured can collect for the loss. But what if the agent represents more than one company? Which one is bound? Typically, the courts will seek a method to allocate liability according to the agent’s common method of distributing business. Or if that is not determinable, relevant losses might be apportioned among the companies equally. Most agents, however, keep records of their communication with insureds, including who is to provide coverage.</p>

    <div class="section" id="baranoff-ch10_s01_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Conditional and Binding Receipts</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch10_s01_s03_p01">Conditional and binding receipts in life insurance are somewhat similar to the binders in property/casualty insurance but contain important differences. If you pay the first premium for a life insurance policy at the time you sign the application, the agent typically will give you either a conditional receipt or a binding receipt. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">conditional receipt</a><span class="glossdef">Policy that does not bind the coverage of life insurance at the time it is issued, but it does put the coverage into effect retroactive to the time of application if one meets all the requirements for insurability as of the date of the application.</span></span> does not bind the coverage of life insurance at the time it is issued, but it does put the coverage into effect retroactive to the time of application if one meets all the requirements for insurability as of the date of the application. A claim for benefits because of death prior to issuance of the policy generally will be honored, but only if you were insurable when you applied. Some conditional receipts, however, require the insured to be in good health when the policy is delivered.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch10_s01_s03_p02">In contrast, a claim for the death benefit under a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">binding receipt</a><span class="glossdef">Policy that will be paid if death occurs while one’s application for life insurance is being processed, even if the deceased is found not to be insurable.</span></span> will be paid if death occurs while one’s application for life insurance is being processed even if the deceased is found not to be insurable. Thus, the binding receipt provides interim coverage while your application is being processed, whether or not you are insurable. This circumstance parallels the protection provided by a binder in property/casualty insurance.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn10_001">In a few states, the conditional receipt is construed to be the same as the binding receipt. See William F. Meyer, <em class="emphasis">Life and Health Insurance Law: A Summary</em>, 2nd ed. (Cincinnati: International Claim Association, 1990), 196–217.</span></p>
