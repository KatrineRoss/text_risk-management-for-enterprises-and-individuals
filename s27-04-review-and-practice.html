        <li>Refer to <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch23_s01#baranoff-ch23_s01_s04_s02_t01">Table 23.3 "Auto Insurance Plan Options"</a>.

        <li>What is the purpose of the waiting period in LTD insurance? How does the Smith family make certain there are no gaps in coverage in the event of disability?</li>
        <li>Examine the insurance premiums allocation shown in <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch23_s01#baranoff-ch23_s01_s05_f01">Figure 23.3 "Monthly Cost Allocation"</a>. Why do you think auto insurance has the highest insurance allocation and life insurance the lowest?</li>
        <li>Do you agree with the Smith family’s assessment of its insurance needs? Are there other relevant facts about the family that should be factored into the decision?</li>

        <li>What employee benefits of the hypothetical Galaxy Max, Inc., are unrealistic and impossible to find in today’s world?</li>

        <li>Explain how to determine which types of coverage to include in a multiyear integrated risk program and the appropriate limits to select.</li>
        <li>It is said that traditionally uninsurable risks are insurable under finite risk programs. Explain why this is possible.</li>
        <li>
            <p class="para">Refer to the information in Part I of the LOCO Corporation hypothetical case study and respond to the following:</p>

                <li>Draw a risk map graph (as described in <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch04#baranoff-ch04">Chapter 4 "Evolving Risk Management: Fundamental Tools"</a>) and place your estimates of the risks faced by the company in the appropriate quadrant.</li>
