<span class="title-prefix">Chapter 3</span> Risk Attitudes: Expected Utility Theory and Demand for Hedging</h1>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_p01" align="center">Authored by Puneet Prakash, Virginia Commonwealth University</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_p02">Whenever we look into risks, risk measures, and risk management, we must always view these in a greater context. In this chapter, we focus on the risk within the “satisfaction” value maximization for individual and firms. The value here is measured economically. So, how do economists measure the value of satisfaction or happiness? Can we even measure satisfaction or happiness? Whatever the philosophical debate might be on the topic, economists have tried to measure the level of satisfaction.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn03_001">At one time, economists measured satisfaction in a unit called “utils” and discussed the highest number of utils as “bliss points”!</span> What economists succeeded in doing is to compare levels of satisfaction an individual achieves when confronted with two or more choices. For example, we suppose that everyone likes to eat gourmet food at five-star hotels, drink French wine, vacation in exotic places, and drive luxury cars. For an economist, all these goods are assumed to provide satisfaction, some more than others. So while eating a meal at home gives us pleasure, eating exotic food at an upscale restaurant gives us an even higher level of satisfaction.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_p03">The problem with the quantity and quality of goods consumed is that we can find no common unit of measurement. That prevents economists from comparing levels of satisfaction from consumption of commodities that are different as apples are different from oranges. So does drinking tea give us the same type of satisfaction as eating cake? Or snorkeling as much as surfing?</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_p04">To get around the problem of comparing values of satisfaction from noncomparable items, we express the value levels of satisfaction as a function of wealth. And indeed, we can understand intuitively that the level of wealth is linked directly to the quantity and quality of consumption a person can achieve. Notice the quality and level of consumption a person achieves is linked to the amount of wealth or to the individual’s budget. Economists consider that greater wealth can generate greater satisfaction. Therefore, a person with greater levels of wealth is deemed to be happier under the condition of everything else being equal between two individuals.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn03_002">Economists are fond of the phrase <em class="emphasis">“ceteris paribus,”</em> which means all else the same. We can only vary one component of human behavior at a time.</span> We can link each person’s satisfaction level indirectly to that person’s wealth. The higher the person’s wealth, the greater his or her satisfaction level is likely to be.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_p05">Economists use the term “utils” to gauge a person’s satisfaction level. As a unit of measure, utils are similar to “<em class="emphasis">ohms</em>” as a measure of resistance in electrical engineering, except that utils cannot be measured with wires attached to a person’s head!</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_p06">This notion that an individual derives satisfaction from wealth seems to work more often than not in economic situations. The economic theory that links the level of satisfaction to a person’s wealth level, and thus to consumption levels, is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">utility theory</a><span class="glossdef">A theory postulated in economics to explain behavior of individuals based on the premise people can consistently rank order their choices depending upon their preferences.</span></span>. Its basis revolves around individuals’ preferences, but we must use caution as we apply utility theory.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn03_003">The utility theory is utilized to <em class="emphasis">compare</em> two or more options. Thus, by its very nature, we refer to the utility theory as an “ordinal” theory, which rank orders choices, rather than “cardinal” utility, which has the ability to attach a number to even a single outcome where there are no choices involved.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_p07">In this chapter, we will study the utility theory. If utility theory is designed to measure satisfaction, and since every individual always tries to maximize satisfaction, it’s reasonable to expect (under utility theory) that each person tries to maximize his or her own utility.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_p08">Then we will extend utility to one of its logical extensions as applied to uncertain situations: expected utility (EU henceforth). So while utility theory deals with situations in which there is no uncertainty, the EU theory deals with choices individuals make when the outcomes they face are uncertain. As we shall see, if individuals maximize utility under certainty, they will also attempt to maximize EU under uncertainty.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_p09">However, individuals’ unabashed EU maximization is not always the case. Other models of human behavior describe behavior in which the observed choices of an individual vary with the decision rule to maximize EU. So why would a mother jump into a river to save her child, even if she does not know how to swim? Economists still confront these and other such questions. They have provided only limited answers to such questions thus far.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_p10">Hence, we will touch upon some uncertainty-laden situations wherein individuals’ observed behavior departs from the EU maximization principle. Systematic departures in behavior from the EU principle stem from “biases” that people exhibit, and we shall discuss some of these biases. Such rationales of observed behavior under uncertainty are termed “behavioral” explanations, rather than “rational” explanations—explanations that explore EU behavior of which economists are so fond.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_p11">In this chapter, we will apply the EU theory to individuals’ hedging decisions/purchase of insurance. Let’s start by asking, Why would anyone buy insurance? When most people face that question, they respond in one of three ways. One set says that insurance provides peace of mind (which we can equate to a level of satisfaction). Others respond more bluntly and argue that if it were not for regulation they’d never buy insurance. The second reply is one received mostly from younger adults. Still others posit that insurance is a “waste of money,” since they pay premiums up front and insurance never pays up in the absence of losses. To all those who argue based upon the third response, one might say, would they rather have a loss for the sake of recovering their premiums? We look to EU theory for some answers, and we will find that even if governments did not make purchase of insurance mandatory, the product would still have existed. Risk-averse individuals would always demand insurance for the peace of mind it confers.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_p12">Thus we will briefly touch upon the ways that insurance is useful, followed by a discussion of how some information problems affect the insurance industry more than any other industry. “Information asymmetry” problems arise, wherein one economic agent in a contract is better informed than the other party to the same contract. The study of information asymmetries has become a full-time occupation for some economics researchers. Notably, professors George A. Akerlof, A. Michael Spence, and Joseph E. Stiglitz were awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2001 for their analyses of information asymmetry problems.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s00_p01">Preferences are not absolute but rather they depend upon market conditions, cultures, peer groups, and surrounding events. Individuals’ preferences nestle within these parameters. Therefore, we can never talk in absolute terms when we talk about satisfaction and preferences. The 2008 crisis, which continued into 2009, provides a good example of how people’s preferences can change very quickly. When people sat around in celebration of 2009 New Year’s Eve, conversation centered on hopes for “making a living” and having some means for income. These same people talked about trips around the world at the end of 2007. Happiness and preferences are a dynamic topic depending upon individuals’ stage of life and economic states of the world. Under each new condition, new preferences arise that fall under the static utility theory discussed below. Economists have researched “happiness,” and continuing study is very important to economists.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn03_004">An academic example is the following study: Yew-Kwang Ng, “A Case for Happiness, Cardinalism, and Interpersonal Comparability,” <em class="emphasis">Economic Journal</em> 107 (1997): 1848–58. She contends that “modern economists are strongly biased in favour of preference (in contrast to happiness), ordinalism, and against interpersonal comparison. I wish to argue for the opposite.” A more popular research is at <em class="emphasis">Forbes</em> on happiness research.<em class="emphasis">Forbes</em> magazine published several short pieces on happiness research.

It is a theory postulated in economics to explain behavior of individuals based on the premise people can consistently rank order their choices depending upon their preferences. Each individual will show different preferences, which appear to be hard-wired within each individual. We can thus state that individuals’ preferences are intrinsic. Any theory, which proposes to capture preferences, is, by necessity, abstraction based on certain assumptions. Utility theory is a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">positive theory</a><span class="glossdef">Theory that seeks to explain an individual’s observed behavior and choices.</span></span> that seeks to explain the individuals’ observed behavior and choices.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn03_005">The distinction between normative and positive aspects of a theory is very important in the discipline of economics. Some people argue that economic theories should be normative, which means they should be prescriptive and tell people what to do. Others argue, often successfully, that economic theories are designed to be explanations of observed behavior of agents in the market, hence positive in that sense.</span> This contrasts with a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">normative theory</a><span class="glossdef">Theory that dictates that people should behave in the manner prescribed by it.</span></span>, one that dictates that people should behave in the manner prescribed by it. Instead, it is only since the theory itself is positive, after observing the choices that individuals make, we can draw inferences about their preferences. When we place certain restrictions on those preferences, we can represent them analytically using a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">utility function</a><span class="glossdef">A mathematical formulation that ranks the preferences of the individual in terms of satisfaction different consumption bundles provide.</span></span>—a mathematical formulation that ranks the preferences of the individual in terms of satisfaction different consumption bundles provide. Thus, under the assumptions of utility theory, we can assume that people behaved as if they had a utility function and acted according to it. Therefore, the fact that a person does not know his/her utility function, or even denies its existence, does not contradict the theory. Economists have used experiments to decipher individuals’ utility functions and the behavior that underlies individuals’ utility.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s01_p02">To begin, assume that an individual faces a set of consumption “bundles.” We assume that individuals have clear preferences that enable them to “rank order” all bundles based on desirability, that is, the level of satisfaction each bundle shall provide to each individual. This rank ordering based on preferences tells us the theory itself has <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ordinal utility</a><span class="glossdef">Utility that can only represent relative levels of satisfaction between two or more alternatives, that is, rank orders them.</span></span>—it is designed to study relative satisfaction levels. As we noted earlier, absolute satisfaction depends upon conditions; thus, the theory by default cannot have <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">cardinal utility</a><span class="glossdef">Utility that can represent the absolute level of satisfaction.</span></span>, or utility that can represent the absolute level of satisfaction. To make this theory concrete, imagine that consumption bundles comprise food and clothing for a week in all different combinations, that is, food for half a week, clothing for half a week, and all other possible combinations.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s01_p03">The utility theory then makes the following assumptions:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s01_l02">
        <li>Completeness: Individuals can rank order all possible bundles. Rank ordering implies that the theory assumes that, no matter how many combinations of consumption bundles are placed in front of the individual, each individual can always rank them in some order based on preferences. This, in turn, means that individuals can somehow compare any bundle with any other bundle and rank them in order of the satisfaction each bundle provides. So in our example, half a week of food and clothing can be compared to one week of food alone, one week of clothing alone, or any such combination. Mathematically, this property wherein an individual’s preferences enable him or her to compare any given bundle with any other bundle is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">completeness</a><span class="glossdef">Property in which an individual’s preferences enable him/her to compare any given consumption bundle with any other bundle.</span></span> property of preferences.</li>
        <li>More-is-better: Assume an individual prefers consumption of bundle A of goods to bundle B. Then he is offered another bundle, which contains more of everything in bundle A, that is, the new bundle is represented by αA where α = 1. The more-is-better assumption says that individuals prefer αA to A, which in turn is preferred to B, but also A itself. For our example, if one week of food is preferred to one week of clothing, then two weeks of food is a preferred package to one week of food. Mathematically, the more-is-better assumption is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">monotonicity assumption</a><span class="glossdef">The assumption that more consumption is always better.</span></span> on preferences. One can always argue that this assumption breaks down frequently. It is not difficult to imagine that a person whose stomach is full would turn down additional food. However, this situation is easily resolved. Suppose the individual is given the option of disposing of the additional food to another person or charity of his or her choice. In this case, the person will still prefer more food even if he or she has eaten enough. Thus under the monotonicity assumption, a hidden property allows costless disposal of excess quantities of any bundle.</li>
        <li>Mix-is-better: Suppose an individual is indifferent to the choice between one week of clothing alone and one week of food. Thus, either choice by itself is not preferred over the other. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">“mix-is-better” assumption</a><span class="glossdef">The assumption that a mix of consumption bundles is always better than stand-alone choices.</span></span> about preferences says that a mix of the two, say half-week of food mixed with half-week of clothing, will be preferred to both stand-alone choices. Thus, a glass of milk mixed with Milo (Nestlè’s drink mix), will be preferred to milk or Milo alone. The mix-is-better assumption is called the “convexity” assumption on preferences, that is, preferences are convex.</li>
        <li>Rationality: This is the most important and controversial assumption that underlies all of utility theory. Under the assumption of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">rationality</a><span class="glossdef">The assumption that individuals’ preferences avoid any kind of circularity.</span></span>, individuals’ preferences avoid any kind of circularity; that is, if bundle A is preferred to B, and bundle B is preferred to C, then A is also preferred to C. Under no circumstances will the individual prefer C to A. You can likely see why this assumption is controversial. It assumes that the innate preferences (rank orderings of bundles of goods) are fixed, regardless of the context and time.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s01_p04">If one thinks of preference orderings as comparative relationships, then it becomes simpler to construct examples where this assumption is violated. So, in “beats”—as in A beat B in college football. These are relationships that are easy to see. For example, if University of Florida beats Ohio State, and Ohio State beats Georgia Tech, it does not mean that Florida beats Georgia Tech. Despite the restrictive nature of the assumption, it is a critical one. In mathematics, it is called the assumption of transitivity of preferences.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s01_p05">Whenever these four assumptions are satisfied, then the preferences of the individual can be represented by a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">well-behaved utility function</a><span class="glossdef">A representation of the preferences of the individual that satisfies the assumptions of completeness, monotonicity, mix-is-better, and rationality.</span></span>.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn03_006">The assumption of convexity of preferences is not required for a utility function representation of an individual’s preferences to exist. But it is necessary if we want that function to be well behaved.</span> Note that the assumptions lead to “a” function, not “the” function. Therefore, the way that individuals represent preferences under a particular utility function may not be unique. Well-behaved utility functions explain why any comparison of individual people’s utility functions may be a futile exercise (and the notion of cardinal utility misleading). Nonetheless, utility functions are valuable tools for representing the preferences of an individual, provided the four assumptions stated above are satisfied. For the remainder of the chapter we will assume that preferences of any individual can always be represented by a well-behaved utility function. As we mentioned earlier, well-behaved utility depends upon the amount of wealth the person owns.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s01_p06">Utility theory rests upon the idea that people behave as if they make decisions by assigning imaginary utility values to the original monetary values. The decision maker sees different levels of monetary values, translates these values into different, hypothetical terms (“utils”), processes the decision in utility terms (not in wealth terms), and translates the result back to monetary terms. So while we observe inputs to and results of the decision in monetary terms, the decision itself is made in utility terms. And given that utility denotes levels of satisfaction, individuals behave as if they maximize the utility, not the level of observed dollar amounts.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s01_p07">While this may seem counterintuitive, let’s look at an example that will enable us to appreciate this distinction better. More importantly, it demonstrates why utility maximization, rather than wealth maximization, is a viable objective. The example is called the “St. Petersburg paradox.” But before we turn to that example, we need to review some preliminaries of uncertainty: probability and statistics.</p>

            <li> In this section we discuss the notion of uncertainty. Mathematical preliminaries discussed in this section form the basis for analysis of individual decision making in uncertain situations.</li>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s02_p01">As we learned in the chapters <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch01#baranoff-ch01">Chapter 1 "The Nature of Risk: Losses and Opportunities"</a> and <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch02#baranoff-ch02">Chapter 2 "Risk Measurement and Metrics"</a>, risk and uncertainty depend upon one another. The origins of the distinction go back to the Mr. Knight,<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn03_007">See Jochen Runde, “Clarifying Frank Knight’s Discussion of the Meaning of Risk and Uncertainty,” <em class="emphasis">Cambridge Journal of Economics</em> 22, no. 5 (1998): 539–46.</span> who distinguished between risk and uncertainty, arguing that measurable uncertainty is risk. In this section, since we focus only on measurable uncertainty, we will not distinguish between risk and uncertainty and use the two terms interchangeably.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s02_p02">As we described in <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch02#baranoff-ch02">Chapter 2 "Risk Measurement and Metrics"</a>, the study of uncertainty originated in games of chance. So when we play games of dice, we are dealing with outcomes that are inherently uncertain. The branch of science of uncertain outcomes is probability and statistics. Notice that the analysis of probability and statistics applies only if outcomes are uncertain. When a student registers for a class but does not attend any lectures nor does any assigned work or test, only one outcome is possible: a failing grade. On the other hand, if the student attends all classes and scores 100 percent on all tests and assignments, then too only one outcome is possible, an “A” grade. In these extreme situations, no uncertainty arises with the outcomes. But between these two extremes lies the world of uncertainty. Students often do research on the instructor and try to get a “feel” for the chance that they will make a particular grade if they register for an instructor’s course.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s02_p03">Even though we covered some of this discussion of probability and uncertainty in <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch02#baranoff-ch02">Chapter 2 "Risk Measurement and Metrics"</a>, we repeat it here for reinforcement. Figuring out the chance, in mathematical terms, is the same as calculating the probability of an event. To compute a probability empirically, we repeat an experiment with uncertain outcomes (called a random experiment) and count the number of times the event of interest happens, say <em class="emphasis">n</em>, in the <em class="emphasis">N</em> trials of the experiment. The empirical probability of the event then equals <em class="emphasis">n</em>/<em class="emphasis">N</em>. So, if one keeps a log of the number of times a computer crashes in a day and records it for 365 days, the probability of the computer crashing on a day will be the sum of all of computer crashes on a daily basis (including zeroes for days it does not crash at all) divided by 365.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s02_p04">For some problems, the probability can be calculated using mathematical deduction. In these cases, we can figure out the probability of getting a head on a coin toss, two aces when two cards are randomly chosen from a deck of 52 cards, and so on (see the example of the dice in <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch02#baranoff-ch02">Chapter 2 "Risk Measurement and Metrics"</a>). We don’t have to conduct a random experiment to actually compute the mathematical probability, as is the case with empirical probability.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s02_p05">Finally, as strongly suggested before, subjective probability is based on a person’s beliefs and experiences, as opposed to empirical or mathematical probability. It may also depend upon a person’s state of mind. Since beliefs may not always be rational, studying behavior using subjective probabilities belongs to the realm of behavioral economics rather than traditional rationality-based economics.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s02_p06">So consider a lottery (a game of chance) wherein several outcomes are possible with defined probabilities. Typically, outcomes in a lottery consist of monetary prizes. Returning to our dice example of <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch02#baranoff-ch02">Chapter 2 "Risk Measurement and Metrics"</a>, let’s say that when a six-faced die is rolled, the payoffs associated with the outcomes are $1 if a 1 turns up, $2 for a 2, …, and $6 for a 6. Now if this game is played once, one and only one amount can be won—$1, $2, and so on. However, if the same game is played many times, what is the amount that one can <em class="emphasis">expect</em> to win?</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s02_p07">Mathematically, the answer to any such question is very straightforward and is given by the expected value of the game.</p>

A fair game, actuarially speaking, is one in which the cost of playing the game equals the expected winnings of the game, so that net value of the game equals zero. We would expect that people are willing to play all fair value games. But in practice, this is not the case.

The payoff from the game is the following: if head appears on the first toss, then $2 is paid to the player, if it appears on the second toss then $4 is paid, if it appears on the third toss, then $8, and so on, so that if head appears on the <em class="emphasis">n<sup class="superscript">th</sup></em> toss then the payout is $2<sup class="superscript">n</sup>.

Thus, while the expected wealth from the lottery may be infinite, the expected utility it provides may be finite. Bernoulli termed this as the “moral value” of the game.

</span> Let the preferences be such that the addition to utility one gets out of an additional dollar at lower levels of wealth is always greater than the additional utility of an extra dollar at higher levels of wealth. So, let us say that when a person has zero wealth (no money), then the person has zero utility. Now if the person receives a dollar, his utility jumps to 1 util. If this person is now given an additional dollar, then as per the monotonicity (more-is-better) assumption, his utility will go up. Let us say that it goes up to 1.414 utils so that the increase in utility is only 0.414 utils, while earlier it was a whole unit (1 util). At 2 dollars of wealth, if the individual receives another dollar, then again his families’ utility rises to a new level, but only to 1.732 utils, an increase of 0.318 units (1.732 − 1.414). This is increasing utility at a decreasing rate for each additional unit of wealth. <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch03_s03_s01_f01">Figure 3.2 "A Utility Function for a Risk-Averse Individual"</a> shows a graph of the utility.</p>

The AFP for the game is $4. Suppose that a person named Terry bears this cost upfront and wins; then his final wealth is $10 − $4 + $10 = $16 (original wealth minus the cost of the game, plus the winning of $10), or else it equals $10 − $4 − $2 = $4 (original wealth minus the cost of the game, minus the loss of $2) in case he loses.

</span> Since the utility is higher when Terry doesn’t play the game, we conclude that any individual whose preferences are depicted by <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch03_s03_s01_f01">Figure 3.2 "A Utility Function for a Risk-Averse Individual"</a> will forgo a game of chance if its cost equals AFP. This is an important result for a concave utility function as shown in <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch03_s03_s01_f01">Figure 3.2 "A Utility Function for a Risk-Averse Individual"</a>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s03_s01_p07">Such a person will need incentives to be willing to play the game. It could come as a price reduction for playing the lottery, or as a premium that compensates the individual for risk. If Terry already faces a risk, he will pay an amount greater than the actuarially fair value to reduce or eliminate the risk. Thus, it works both ways—consumers demand a premium above AFP to take on risk. Just so, insurance companies charge individuals premiums for risk transfer via insurances.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s03_s01_p08">An individual—let’s name him Johann—has preferences that are characterized by those shown in <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch03_s03_s01_f01">Figure 3.2 "A Utility Function for a Risk-Averse Individual"</a> (i.e., by a concave or diminishing marginal utility function). Johann is a risk-averse person. We have seen that a risk-averse person refuses to play an actuarially fair game. Such risk aversions also provide a natural incentive for Johann to demand (or, equivalently, pay) a risk premium above AFP to take on (or, equivalently, get rid of) risk. Perhaps you will recall from <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch01#baranoff-ch01">Chapter 1 "The Nature of Risk: Losses and Opportunities"</a> that introduced a more mathematical measure to the description of risk aversion. In an experimental study, Holt and Laury (2002) find that a majority of their subjects under study made “safe choices,” that is, displayed risk aversion. Since real-life situations can be riskier than laboratory settings, we can safely assume that a majority of people are risk averse most of the time. What about the remainder of the population?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s03_s01_p09">We know that most of us do not behave as risk-averse people all the time. In the later 1990s, the stock market was considered to be a “bubble,” and many people invested in the stock market despite the preferences they exhibited before this time. At the time, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan introduced the term “irrational exuberance” in a speech given at the American Enterprise Institute. The phrase has become a regular way to describe people’s deviations from normal preferences. Such behavior was also repeated in the early to mid-2000s with a real estate bubble. People without the rational means to buy homes bought them and took “nonconventional risks,” which led to the 2008–2009 financial and credit crisis and major recessions (perhaps even depression) as President Obama took office in January 2009. We can regard external market conditions and the “herd mentality” to be significant contributors to changing rational risk aversion traits.</p>
        <p class="para block" id="baranoff-ch03_s03_s01_p10">An individual may go skydiving, hang gliding, and participate in high-risk-taking behavior. Our question is, can the expected utility theory capture that behavior as well? Indeed it can, and that brings us to risk-seeking behavior and its characterization in E(U) theory. Since risk-seeking behavior exhibits preferences that seem to be the opposite of risk aversion, the mathematical functional representation may likewise show opposite behavior. For a risk-loving person, the utility function will show the shape given in <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch03_s03_s01_f02">Figure 3.3 "A Utility Function for a Risk-Seeking Individual"</a>. It shows that the greater the level of wealth of the individual, the higher is the increase in utility when an additional dollar is given to the person.

    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s04_p02">While expected utility theory provides a valuable tool for analyzing how rational people should make decisions under uncertainty, the observed behavior may not always bear it out. Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky (1974) were the first to provide evidence that E(U) theory doesn’t provide a complete description of how people actually decide under uncertain conditions. The authors conducted experiments that demonstrate this variance from the E(U) theory, and these experiments have withstood the test of time. It turns out that individual behavior under some circumstances violates the axioms of rational choice of E(U) theory.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s04_p03">Kahneman and Tversky (1981) provide the following example: Suppose the country is going to be struck by the avian influenza (bird flu) pandemic. Two programs are available to tackle the pandemic, A and B. Two sets of physicians, X and Y, are set with the task of containing the disease. Each group has the outcomes that the two programs will generate. However, the outcomes have different phrasing for each group. Group X is told about the efficacy of the programs in the following words:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s04_l02">
        <li>Program A: If adopted, it will save exactly 200 out of 600 patients.</li>
        <li>Program B: If adopted, the probability that 600 people will be saved is 1/3, while the probability that no one will be saved is 2/3.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s04_p04">Seventy-six percent of the doctors in group X chose to administer program A.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s04_p05">Group Y, on the other hand, is told about the efficacy of the programs in these words:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s04_l03">
        <li>Program A: If adopted, exactly 400 out of 600 patients will die.</li>
        <li>Program B: If adopted, the probability that nobody will die is 1/3, while the probability that all 600 will die is 2/3.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s04_p06">Only 13 percent of the doctors in this group chose to administer program A.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s04_p07">The only difference between the two sets presented to groups X and Y is the description of the outcomes. Every outcome to group X is defined in terms of “saving lives,” while for group Y it is in terms of how many will “die.” Doctors, being who they are, have a bias toward “saving” lives, naturally.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s04_p08">This experiment has been repeated several times with different subjects and the outcome has always been the same, even if the numbers differ. Other experiments with different groups of people also showed that the way alternatives are worded result in different choices among groups. The coding of alternatives that makes individuals vary from E(U) maximizing behavior is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">framing effect</a><span class="glossdef">The coding of alternatives, which makes individuals vary from E(U) maximizing behavior.</span></span>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s04_p09">In order to explain these deviations from E(U), Kahneman and Tversky suggest that individuals use a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">value function</a><span class="glossdef">A mathematical formulation that seeks to explain observed behavior without making any assumption about preferences.</span></span> to assess alternatives. This is a mathematical formulation that seeks to explain observed behavior without making any assumption about preferences. The nature of the value function is such that it is much steeper in losses than in gains. The authors insist that it is a purely descriptive device and is not derived from axioms like the E(U) theory. In the language of mathematics we say the value function is convex in losses and concave in gains. For the same concept, economists will say that the function is risk seeking in losses and risk averse in gains. A Kahneman and Tversky value function is shown in <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch03_s04_f01">Figure 3.5 "Value Function of Kahneman and Tversky"</a>.</p>

A loss of $200 causes the individual to feel more value is lost compared to an equivalent gain of $200. To see this notice that on the losses side (the negative x-axis) the graph falls more steeply than the rise in the graph on the gains side (positive x-axis). And this is true regardless of the initial level of wealth the person has initially.</p>
    <p class="para block" id="baranoff-ch03_s04_p11">The implications of this type of value function for marketers and sellers are enormous. Note that the value functions are convex in losses.

</span> Thus, when gains are segregated, the sum of the value of gains turns out to be higher than the value of the sum of gains. So the idea would be to report combined losses, while segregating gains.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s04_p13">Since the individual feels differently about losses and gains, the analysis of the value function tells us that to offset a small loss, we require a larger gain. So small losses can be combined with larger gains, and the individual still feels “happier” since the net effect will be that of a gain. However, if losses are too large, then combining them with small gains would result in a net loss, and the individual would feel that value has been lost. In this case, it’s better to segregate the losses from the gains and report them separately. Such a course of action will provide a consolation to the individual of the type: “At least there are some gains, even if we suffer a big loss.”</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s04_p14">Framing effects are not the only reason why people deviate from the behavior predicted by E(U) theory. We discuss some other reasons next, though the list is not exhaustive; a complete study is outside the scope of the text.</p>

        <li>
            <p class="para">Overweighting and underweighting of probabilities. Recall that E(U) is the sum of products of two sets of numbers: first, the utility one receives in each state of the world and second, the probabilities with which each state could occur. However, most of the time probabilities are not assigned objectively, but subjectively. For example, before Hurricane Katrina in 2005, individuals in New Orleans would assign a very small probability to flooding of the type experienced in the aftermath of Katrina. However, after the event, the subjective probability estimates of flooding have risen considerably among the same set of individuals.</p>
            <p class="para" id="baranoff-ch03_s04_p15">Humans tend to give more weight to events of the recent past than to look at the entire history. We could attribute such a bias to limited memory, individuals’ myopic view, or just easy availability of more recent information. We call this bias to work with whatever information is easily availability an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">availability bias</a><span class="glossdef">Tendency to work with whatever information is easily availability.</span></span>. But people deviate from E(U) theory for more reasons than simply weighting recent past more versus ignoring overall history.</p>
            <p class="para" id="baranoff-ch03_s04_p16">Individuals also react to <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">experience bias</a><span class="glossdef">Tendency to assign more weight to the state of the world that we have experienced and less to others.</span></span>. Since all of us are shaped somewhat by our own experiences, we tend to assign more weight to the state of the world that we have experienced and less to others. Similarly, we might assign a very low weight to a bad event occurring in our lives, even to the extent of convincing ourselves that such a thing could never happen to us. That is why we see women avoiding mammograms and men colonoscopies. On the other hand, we might attach a higher-than-objective probability to good things happening to us. No matter what the underlying cause is, availability or experience, we know empirically that the probability weights are adjusted subjectively by individuals. Consequently, their observed behavior deviates from E(U) theory.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="para">Anchoring bias. Often individuals base their subjective assessments of outcomes based on an initial “guesstimate.” Such a guess may not have any reasonable relationship to the outcomes being studied. In an experimental study reported by Kahneman and Tversky in <em class="emphasis">Science</em> (1974), the authors point this out. The authors call this <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">anchoring bias</a><span class="glossdef">Tendency to base subjective assessments of outcomes on an initial estimate.</span></span>; it has the effect of biasing the probability estimates of individuals. The experiment they conducted ran as follows:</p>
            <p class="para" id="baranoff-ch03_s04_p17">First, each individual under study had to spin a wheel of fortune with numbers ranging from zero to one hundred. Then, the authors asked the individual if the percent of African nations in the United Nations (UN) was lower or higher than the number on the wheel. Finally, the individuals had to provide an estimate of the percent of African nations in the UN. The authors observed that those who spun a 10 or lower had a median estimate of 25 percent, while those who spun 65 or higher provided a median estimate of 45 percent.</p>
            <p class="para" id="baranoff-ch03_s04_p18">Notice that the number obtained on the wheel had no correlation with the question being asked. It was a randomly generated number. However, it had the effect of making people anchor their answers around the initial number that they had obtained. Kahneman and Tversky also found that even if the payoffs to the subjects were raised to encourage people to provide a correct estimate, the anchoring effect was still evident.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="para">Failure to ignore sunk costs. This is the most common reason why we observe departures from E(U) theory. Suppose a person goes to the theater to watch a movie and discovers that he lost $10 on the way. Another person who had bought an online ticket for $10 finds he lost the ticket on the way. The decision problem is: “Should these people spend another $10 to watch the movie?” In experiments conducted suggesting exactly the same choices, respondents’ results show that the second group is more likely to go home without watching the movie, while the first one will overwhelmingly (88 percent) go ahead and watch the movie.</p>
            <p class="para" id="baranoff-ch03_s04_p19">Why do we observe this behavior? The two situations are exactly alike. Each group lost $10. But in a world of mental accounting, the second group has already spent the money on the movie. So this group mentally assumes a cost of $20 for the movie. However, the first group had lost $10 that was not marked toward a specific expense. The second group does not have the “feel” of a lost ticket worth $10 as a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sunk cost</a><span class="glossdef">Money spent that cannot be recovered.</span></span>, which refers to money spent that cannot be recovered. What should matter under E(U) theory is only the value of the movie, which is $10. Whether the ticket or cash was lost is immaterial. Systematic accounting for sunk costs (which economists tell us that we should ignore) causes departures from rational behavior under E(U) theory.</p>
            <p class="para" id="baranoff-ch03_s04_p20">The failure to ignore sunk costs can cause individuals to continue to invest in ventures that are already losing money. Thus, somebody who bought shares at $1,000 that now trade at $500 will continue to hold on to them. They realized that the $1,000 is sunk and thus ignore it. Notice that under rational expectations, what matters is the value of the shares now. Mental accounting tells the shareholders that the value of the shares is still $1,000; the individual does not sell the shares at $500. Eventually, in the economists’ long run, the shareholder may have to sell them for $200 and lose a lot more. People regard such a loss in value as a paper loss versus real loss, and individuals may regard real loss as a greater pain than a paper loss.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s04_p21">By no mean is the list above complete. Other kinds of cognitive biases intervene that can lead to deviating behavior from E(U) theory. But we must notice one thing about E(U) theory versus the value function approach. The E(U) theory is an axiomatic approach to the study of human behavior. If those axioms hold, it can actually predict behavior. On the other hand the value function approach is designed only to <em class="emphasis">describe</em> what actually happens, rather than what <em class="emphasis">should</em> happen.</p>

A risk-averse person will always hedge the risk completely at a cost that equals the expected loss. This cost is the actuarially fair premium (AFP).

Ty tells himself, “As long as the premium P is such that I am above the E(U) line when I do not purchase insurance, I would be willing to pay it.” So starting from the initial wealth W<sub class="subscript">0</sub>, we deduct P, up to the point that the utility of final wealth equals the expected utility given by the point E(U) on the y-axis.

The AFP = the distance between initial wealth W<sub class="subscript">0</sub> and E (FW) (= E [L]), and the distance between E (FW) and W<sub class="subscript">2</sub>. This distance is called the risk premium (RP, shown as the length ED in <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch03_s05_f01">Figure 3.6 "Risk Aversion"</a> [c]) and in Ty’s case above, it equals $54.29 − $50 = $4.29.</p>

            <p class="para" id="baranoff-ch03_s05_p17">Thus, we see that individuals’ risk aversion is a key component in insurance pricing. The greater the degree of risk aversion, the higher the risk premium an individual will be willing to pay. But the insurance price has to be such that the premium charged turns out to be less than or equal to the maximum premium the person is willing to pay. Otherwise, the individual will never buy full insurance.</p>
            <p class="para" id="baranoff-ch03_s05_p18">Thus, risk aversion is a necessary condition for transfer of risks. Since insurance is one mechanism through which a risk-averse person transfers risk, risk aversion is of paramount importance to insurance demand.</p>

        </ul>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s06_p01">We all know about the used-car market and the market for “lemons.” Akerlof (1970) was the first to analyze how <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">information asymmetry</a><span class="glossdef">A problem encountered when one party knows more than the other party in the contract.</span></span> can cause problems in any market. This is a problem encountered when one party knows more than the other party in the contract. In particular, it addresses how information differences between buyers and the sellers (information asymmetry) can cause market failure. These differences are the underlying causes of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">adverse selection</a><span class="glossdef">Situation in which a person with higher risk chooses to hedge the risk, preferably without paying more for the greater risk.</span></span>, a situation under which a person with higher risk chooses to hedge the risk, preferably without paying more for the greater risk. Adverse selection refers to a particular kind of information asymmetry problem, namely, hidden information.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s06_p02">A second kind of information asymmetry lies in the hidden action, wherein one party’s actions are not observable by the counterparty to the contract. Economists study this issue as one of moral hazard.</p>
    <div class="section" id="baranoff-ch03_s06_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Adverse Selection</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s06_s01_p01">Consider the used-car market. While the sellers of used cars know the quality of their cars, the buyers do not know the exact quality (imagine a world with no blue book information available). From the buyer’s point of view, the car may be a lemon. Under such circumstances, the buyer’s offer price reflects the <em class="emphasis">average</em> quality of the cars in the market.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s06_s01_p02">When sellers approach a market in which average prices are offered, sellers who <em class="emphasis">know</em> that their cars are of better quality do not sell their cars. (This example can be applied to the mortgage and housing crisis in 2008. Sellers who knew that their houses are worth more prefer to hold on to them, instead of lowering the price in order to just make a sale). When they withdraw their cars from market, the average quality of the cars for sale goes down. Buyers’ offer prices get revised downward in response. As a result, the new level of better-quality car sellers withdraws from the market. As this cycle continues, only lemons remain in the market, and the market for used cars fails. As a result of an information asymmetry, the bad-quality product drives away the good-quality ones from the market. This phenomenon is called adverse selection.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s06_s01_p03">It’s easy to demonstrate adverse selection in health insurance. Imagine two individuals, one who is healthy and the other who is not. Both approach an insurance company to buy health insurance policies. Assume for a moment that the two individuals are alike in all respects but their health condition. Insurers can’t observe applicants’ health status; this is private information. If insurers could find no way to figure out the health status, what would it do?</p>
        <p class="para block" id="baranoff-ch03_s06_s01_p04">Suppose the insurer’s price schedule reads, “Charge $10 monthly premium to the healthy one, and $25 to the unhealthy one.” If the insurer is asymmetrically informed of the health status of each applicant, it would charge an average premium <span class="inlineequation"><math xml:id="baranoff_ch03_s06_m001" display="inline">

</span> to each. If insurers charge an average premium, the healthy individual would decide to retain the health risk and remain uninsured. In such a case, the insurance company would be left with only unhealthy policyholders. Note that these less-healthy people would happily purchase insurance, since while their actual cost should be $25 they are getting it for $17.50. In the long run, however, what happens is that the claims from these individuals exceed the amount of premium collected from them. Eventually, the insurance company may become insolvent and go bankrupt. Adverse selection thus causes bankruptcy and market failure. What is the solution to this problem? The easiest is to charge $25 to all individuals regardless of their health status. In a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">monopolistic market</a><span class="glossdef">A market with only one supplier.</span></span> of only one supplier without competition this might work but not in a competitive market. Even in a close-to-competitive market the effect of adverse selection is to increase prices.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s06_s01_p05">How can one mitigate the extent of adverse selection and its effects? The solution lies in reducing the level of information asymmetry. Thus we find that insurers ask a lot of questions to determine the risk types of individuals. In the used-car market, the buyers do the same. Specialized agencies provide used-car information. Some auto companies certify their cars. And buyers receive warranty offers when they buy used cars.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s06_s01_p06">Insurance agents ask questions and undertake individuals’ risk classification according to risk types. In addition, leaders in the insurance market also developed solutions to adverse selection problems. This comes in the form of risk sharing, which also means partial insurance. Under partial insurance, companies offer products with <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">deductibles</a><span class="glossdef">Initial part of the loss absorbed by the person who incurs the loss.</span></span> (the initial part of the loss absorbed by the person who incurs the loss) and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">coinsurance</a><span class="glossdef">Situation where individuals share in the losses with the insurance companies.</span></span>, where individuals share in the losses with the insurance companies. It has been shown that high-risk individuals prefer full insurance, while low-risk individuals choose partial insurance (high deductibles and coinsurance levels). Insurance companies also offer policies where the premium is adjusted at a later date based on the claim experience of the policyholder during the period.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s06_s02_p12">Wonku’s behavior thus changes from driving with care to driving without care after purchasing insurance. Why do we get this result? In this example, the cost of insurance is cheaper than the cost of care. Insurance companies can charge a price greater than the cost of care up to a maximum of what Wonku is willing to pay. However, in the event of asymmetric information, the insurance company will not know the cost of care. Thus, inexpensive insurance distorts the incentives and individuals switch to riskier behavior ex post.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s06_s02_p13">In this moral hazard example, the probabilities of having a loss are affected, not the loss amounts. In practice, both will be affected. At its limit, when moral hazard reaches a point where the intention is to cheat the insurance company, it manifests itself in fraudulent behavior.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s06_s02_p14">How can we solve this problem? An ideal solution would be continuous monitoring, which is prohibitively expensive and may not even be legal for privacy issues. Alternatively, insurance companies try and gather as much information as possible to arrive at an estimate of the cost of care or lack of it. Also, more information leads to an estimate of the likelihood that individuals will switch to riskier behavior afterwards. So questions like marital status/college degree and other personal information might be asked. Insurance companies will undertake a process called risk classification. We discuss this important process later in the text.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s06_s02_p15">So far we have learned how individuals’ risk aversion and information asymmetry explain behavior associated with hedging. But do these reasons also hold when we study why corporations hedge their risks? We provide the answer to this question next.</p>

            <li>Why should corporations hedge? Financial theory tells us that in a perfect world, corporations are risk neutral. Students can learn in this section the reasons why large companies hedge risk, and, in particular, why they buy insurance.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s07_p01">Financial theory tells us that corporations are risk neutral. This is because only the systematic risk matters, while a particular company can diversify the idiosyncratic risk<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn03_014">Systematic risk is the risk that everyone has to share, each according to his/her capacity. Idiosyncratic risk, on the other hand, falls only on a small section of the population. While systematic risk cannot be transferred to anyone outside since it encompasses all agents, idiosyncratic risk can be transferred for a price. That is why idiosyncratic risk is called diversifiable, and systematic is not. The economy-wide recession that unfolded in 2008 is a systematic risk in which everyone is affected.</span> away. If we think about a large company held by a large number of small shareholders like us, then we’d prefer that the company not hedge its risks. In fact, if we wanted to hedge those risks we can do it ourselves. We hold a particular company’s shares because we are looking for those particular risks.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s07_p02">Look back at <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch03_s03#baranoff-ch03_s03_s01_f03">Figure 3.4 "A Utility Function for a Risk-Neutral Individual"</a>. Since firms are risk neutral, their value function is the straight line that appears in the figure. Thus corporations will hedge risk only at their AFP, otherwise they will not. But we know that insurance companies cannot really sell policies at AFP, since they also have to cover their costs and profits. Yet we find that corporations still buy these hedging instruments at greater price than AFP. Therefore, to find a rationale for corporations hedging behavior, we have to move beyond the individual level utility functions of risk aversion.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s07_p03">The following are several reasons for companies hedging behavior:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s07_l02">
        <li>Managers hedge because they are undiversified: Small shareholders like us can diversify our risks, but managers cannot. They invest their income from labor as well as their personal assets in the firm. Therefore, while owners (principals) are diversified, managers (agents) are not. Since managers are risk averse and they control the company directly, they hedge.</li>
        <li>Managers want to lower expected bankruptcy costs: If a company goes bankrupt, then bankruptcy supervisors investigate and retain a part of the company’s assets. The wealth gets transferred to third parties and constitutes a loss of assets to the rightful owners. Imagine a fire that destroys the plant. If the company wants to avoid bankruptcy, it might want to rebuild it. If rebuilding is financed through debt financing, the cost of debt is going to be very high because the company may not have any collateral to offer. In this case, having fire insurance can serve as collateral as well as compensate the firm when it suffers a loss due to fire.</li>
        <li>Risk bearers may be in a better position to bear the risk: Companies may not be diversified, in terms of either product or geography. They may not have access to broader capital markets because of small size. Companies may transfer risk to better risk bearers that are diversified and have better and broader access to capital markets.</li>
        <li>Hedging can increase debt capacity: Financial theory tells us about an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">optimal capital structure</a><span class="glossdef">A company’s optimal mix of debt and equity financing.</span></span> for every company. This means that each company has an optimal mix of debt and equity financing. The amount of debt determines the financial risk to a company. With hedging, the firm can transfer the risk outside the firm. With lower risk, the firm can undertake a greater amount of debt, thus changing the optimal capital structure.</li>
        <li>Lowering of tax liability: Since insurance premiums are tax deductible for some corporate insurance policies, companies can lower the expected taxes by purchasing insurance.</li>
        <li>Other reasons: We can cite some other reasons why corporations hedge. Regulated companies are found to hedge more than unregulated ones, probably because law limits the level of risk taking. Laws might require companies to purchase some insurance mandatorily. For example, firms might need aircraft liability insurance, third-party coverage for autos, and workers compensation. Firms may also purchase insurance to signal credit worthiness (e.g., construction coverage for commercial builders). Thus, the decision to hedge can reduce certain kinds of information asymmetry problems as well.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s07_p04">We know that corporations hedge their risks, either through insurance or through other financial contracts. Firms can use forwards and futures, other derivatives, and option contracts to hedge their risk. The latter are not pure hedges and firms can use them to take on more risks instead of transferring them outside the firm. Forwards and futures, derivatives, and option contracts present the firm with double-edged swords. Still, because of their complex nature, corporations are in a better position to use it than the individuals who mostly use insurance contracts to transfer their risk.</p>

        <li>Explain the difference between moral hazard and adverse selection. Can one exist without the other?</li>
        <li>What externalities are caused in the insurance market by moral hazard and adverse selection? How are they overcome in practice?</li>
        <li>Do risk-averse individuals outnumber risk-seeking ones? Give an intuitive explanation.</li>
        <li>Provide examples that appear to violate expected utility theory and risk aversion.</li>
        <li>Give two examples that tell how the framing of alternatives affects peoples’ choices under uncertainty.</li>
        <li>Suppose you are a personal financial planner managing the portfolio of your mother. In a recession like the one in 2008, there are enormous losses and very few gains to the assets in the portfolio you suggested to your mother. Given the material covered in this chapter, suggest a few marketing strategies to minimize the pain of bad news to your mother.</li>
        <li>Distinguish, through examples, between sunk cost, availability bias, and anchoring effect as reasons for departure from the expected utility paradigm.</li>
        <li>Suppose Yuan Yuan wants to purchase a house for investment purposes. She will rent it out after buying it. She has two choices. Either buy it in an average location where the lifetime rent from the property will be $700,000 with certainty or buy it in an upscale location. However, in the upscale neighborhood there is a 60 percent chance that the lifetime income will equal $1 million and 40 percent chance it will equal only $250,000. If she has a utility function that equals <span class="inlineequation"><math xml:id="baranoff_ch03_s08_m001" display="inline">

        <li>Suppose Yijia’s utility function is given by LN(W) and her initial wealth is $500,000. If there is a 0.01 percent chance that a liability lawsuit will reduce her wealth to $50,000, how much premium will she be willing to pay to get rid of the risk?</li>
        <li>Your professor of economics tells you, “The additional benefit that a person derives from a given increase of his stock of a thing decreases with every increase in the stock he already has.” What type of risk attitude does such a person have?</li>
        <li>Ms. Frangipani prefers Pepsi to Coke on a rainy day; Coke to Pepsi on a sunny one. On one sunny day at the CNN center in Atlanta, when faced with a choice between Pepsi, Coke, and Lipton iced tea, she decides to have a Pepsi. Should the presence of iced teas in the basket of choices affect her decision? Does she violate principles of utility maximization? If yes, which assumptions does she violate? If not, then argue how her choices are consistent with the utility theory.</li>
        <li>Explain why a risk-averse person will purchase insurance for the following scenario: Lose $20,000 with 5 percent chance or lose $0 with 95 percent probability. The premium for the policy is $1,000.</li>
