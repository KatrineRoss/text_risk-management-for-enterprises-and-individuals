        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s01_s01_p01">The purpose of this project is to build a portfolio of risk management and insurance coverages for a hypothetical family. This report is typical of those produced by students as a group project in the author’s risk and insurance classes. The students present sections of the types of coverage they design throughout the semester and submit the complete project at the end of the semester as part of their final grade. The students live the project during the semester and provide creativity along with hands-on knowledge and information about the best risk management for their fictional families. Many groups develop special relationship with helpful agents who volunteer to speak to the class. The help that agents provide receives high marks from most students.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s01_s01_p02">This report, as all the others produced by the students, considers property, auto, disability, life, health, and long-term care insurance, as well as retirement planning. The group project presented here does not involve the agent-customer relationship. Many other reports do include the relationship as a reason to buy from a specific company.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Family Description</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s01_s03_p01">John is a thirty-five-year-old nuclear engineer who has been working for Virginia Power since 1999. His wife, Karen, is a thirty-year-old homemaker. They have been married for five years. John and Karen have a nine-month-old infant named Tristian. John and Karen are in good health. They are looking forward to having another child, but Karen has high pregnancy risk. This has to be taken into consideration when selecting health insurance coverage for the family. Their annual net income is $72,000 (John’s salary of $100,000, less taxes and other deductions). They own two cars. John drives a 1996 Toyota Corolla and Karen drives a 1997 Toyota Camry. They need good insurance coverage because John is the only one who is working. All the insurance providers examined have ratings of “A” or better in A.M. Best ratings.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Homeowners Insurance</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s01_s04_s01_p01">John and Karen purchased a two-story single home for $150,000 in 1996. The house is located on 7313 Pineleaf Drive in Richmond, Virginia. The total footage is 2,014 square feet. There is a two-car attached garage. John and Karen decided not to renew their homeowners insurance with AllState Insurance because of the expensive premium and unacceptable customer service they experienced in the past. John did research on the Internet and found quotes from different companies. He was asked to give detailed information on the house. The house is located within 1,000 feet of a fire hydrant and it is one hundred feet away from a fire station. John promised to install a security system to prevent theft. Karen wanted extra protection on her precious jewelry worth $10,000, Ming china worth $5,000, and antique paintings valued at $7,000. They need scheduled personal property endorsements. Over the last five years, John and Karen’s house has appreciated by $10,000. They want to insure the home to 100 percent of its estimated replacement cost, which is $160,000, rather than 80 percent. In case of a total loss, the insurer will replace the home exactly as it was before the loss took place, even if the replacement exceeds the amount of insurance stated in the policy. <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch23_s01_s04_s01_t01">Table 23.2 "Homeowners Insurance Plan Options"</a> summarizes the coverage quoted by three insurance companies.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s01_s04_s04_p01">The Smith family realized they needed to invest in additional term life insurance for John because his employer provided only term life coverage in the amount of one times his salary, $100,000. They did not need to worry about life insurance for Karen because her parents bought a ten-year level term coverage in the amount of $250,000 on Karen’s life when Tristian was born. They told Karen that an untimely death would mean an economic loss to the family because John would likely have to hire help for housekeeping and child care.</p>

He enjoys working out at the gym after work at least three days a week and has never been a smoker. John’s family history shows no serious health problems, and most of his relatives have lived well into their seventies.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s01_s04_s04_p03">To decide how much life insurance is needed for John, he and Karen worked on a needs analysis with some friends who are familiar with financial planning. They came to the conclusion that he will need to purchase $300,000 additional coverage. The following breakdown shows why they believe they need this amount of coverage:</p>

All of Virginia Power’s benefit coverage is provided by Anthem, a Blue Cross/Blue Shield company with A++ rating. Employees of Virginia Power and their family members are covered on the date employment begins. Benefits will be provided at the in-network level to an employee who lives outside the network’s geographic area. In-network participants must receive preventative care benefits from PPO providers.

On the third day of the vacation, John suffers chest pains while running and collapses. John is rushed by ambulance to a nearby hospital where he is diagnosed with a bronchial infection. X-rays and lab work total $300. The family pays 20 percent of the bill because they had met their deductible for the year. Their total out-of-pocket expenses for the visit are $60. Though disappointed that he can’t jog for a week or two, John is thankful that, even out of state, he is able to have expert medical care and return to his family to enjoy the remainder of his vacation.</p>

Virginia Power matches contributions at 50 percent. John chose to defer 4 percent of his salary ($240 monthly). When added to Virginia Power’s 2 percent, or $120, the monthly total is $360. The contribution is invested in mutual funds. John’s 401(k) current balance is $32,000 and he hopes he will be able to invest it wisely.

        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s01_s06_p01">With the help from all group members working on the project, the Smith family is able to choose the best coverage they can get from various insurance plans. Their homeowners insurance is provided by Travelers Insurance Company; their auto is covered by Harford Insurance Company. They bought additional life insurance from Western-Southern Life Company and additional long-term disability from Erie. Virginia Power provides good health care coverage, term life insurance, a 401(k) retirement plan, and long-term disability. The Smith family chose insurance plans that best fit their needs.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
            <p class="para" id="baranoff-ch23_s01_s06_p02">In this section you studied how the needs of a hypothetical family affect the selection of insurance coverage and employee benefits:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="baranoff-ch23_s01_s06_l01">
                <li>Value of real and personal property, loss provisions, premiums, and deductibles, and company financial strength ratings all influence the amounts and types of homeowners coverage as well as the selection of the insurer.</li>
                <li>In the underwriting of auto insurance, insurers consider the accident history, age of the driver, market value, utility, and purpose of the vehicle.</li>
                <li>Employers may offer basic life and disability insurance benefits, but a family should consider supplemental coverage if its income is provided by a sole breadwinner.</li>
                <li>Family planning, desire for flexibility, and the overall health of family members are important considerations in the choice of health insurance.</li>
                <li>Employer-sponsored retirement options can be adequate to meet a family’s retirement needs if the family saves and invests wisely in relation to their age and expected retirement.</li>
                <li>A family needs analysis should include a family income statement including monthly income less insurance premiums, retirement savings, utility bills, and other monthly expenses to assess the feasibility of the plan.</li>

            <h3 class="title">Discussion Questions</h3>
            <ol class="orderedlist" id="baranoff-ch23_s01_s06_l02">
                <li>What provision in homeowners insurance allows John and Karen to have their home replaced at 100 percent of its value rather than 80 percent?</li>
                <li>Why was the family asked to give detailed geographic information about the home when they were obtaining insurance quotes?</li>
                <li>What does it mean to schedule personal property? Why would Karen choose to do this?</li>
                <li>Why must John provide evidence of insurability for his supplemental life insurance coverage but not his basic group coverage?</li>
                <li>What does liability listed as “100,000/300,000/100,000” in the Smiths’ auto insurance policy refer to?</li>
                <li>What needs should be considered when determining the amount of life insurance coverage?</li>
                <li>Do you think the ten-year level term life insurance coverage on Karen is appropriate?</li>
                <li>What features make a PPO plan preferable to an HMO for the Smiths?</li>
