    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch01_s01_p01">Our “links” section in each chapter ties each concept and objective in the chapter into the realm of globally or holistically managing risk. The solutions to risk problems require a compilation of techniques and perspectives, shown as the pieces completing a puzzle of the myriad of personal and business risks we face. These are shown in the “connection” puzzle in <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch01_s01_f01">Figure 1.1 "Complete Picture of the Holistic Risk Puzzle"</a>. As we progress through the text, each chapter will begin with a connection section to show how links between personal and enterprise holistic risk picture arise.</p>

The insurance studies of Virginia Commonwealth University held a town hall meeting the week after Katrina to discuss the natural and man-made disasters and their impact both financially and socially.
