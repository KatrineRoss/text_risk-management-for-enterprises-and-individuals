    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_p01">At this point you should feel somewhat comfortable with most of the overall picture of risk, but despite the many examples of risk management and types of coverage you have seen, the details of each coverage are not explicit yet. In this chapter, we will elaborate on property risks, including electronic commerce, or e-commerce, risk and global risk exposures. In <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch12#baranoff-ch12">Chapter 12 "The Liability Risk Management"</a>, we will elaborate on liability risks overall and the particulars of e-commerce liability. Home coverage that includes both property and liability coverage will be discussed in detail in <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch01#baranoff-ch01">Chapter 1 "The Nature of Risk: Losses and Opportunities"</a>. Auto coverage will be discussed in <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch01#baranoff-ch01">Chapter 1 "The Nature of Risk: Losses and Opportunities"</a>. <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch13#baranoff-ch13">Chapter 13 "Multirisk Management Contracts: Homeowners"</a> and <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch14#baranoff-ch14">Chapter 14 "Multirisk Management Contracts: Auto"</a> focus on personal lines coverage. <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch15#baranoff-ch15">Chapter 15 "Multirisk Management Contracts: Business"</a> and <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch16#baranoff-ch16">Chapter 16 "Risks Related to the Job: Workers’ Compensation and Unemployment Compensation"</a> take us into the world of commercial lines coverage and workers’ compensation. In this part of the text, you will be asked to relate sections of the actual policies provided in the appendixes at the end of the textbook to loss events. Our work will clarify many areas of property and liability of various risks, including the most recent e-commerce risk exposures and the fundamental global risk exposure. In this chapter, we cover the following:</p>

    </ol>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Links</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s00_p01">The most important part of property coverage is that you, as the first party, are eligible to receive benefits in the event you or your business suffers a loss. In contrast, liability coverage, discussed in <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch12#baranoff-ch12">Chapter 12 "The Liability Risk Management"</a>, pays benefits to a third party if you cause a loss (or if someone causes you to have a loss, his or her liability insurance would pay benefits to you). In this chapter we focus on the first type: coverage for you when your property is damaged or lost.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s00_p02">In personal lines coverage such as homeowners and auto policies, the property coverage for losses you sustain, as the owner of the property, is only part of the policies. In commercial lines, you may use a packaged multilines policy that includes both commercial property and commercial general liability policies. In this chapter we focus only on the part of the policies relating to the property coverage for first-party damages to you. As part of your holistic risk and risk management, it is important to have an appreciation of this part of the coverage.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s00_p03">As we develop the holistic risk management program, you now realize that you need a myriad of policies to cover all your property exposures, including that of e-commerce, and another myriad of policies to protect your liability exposures. In some cases, property and liability coverages are packaged together, such as in homeowners and auto policies, but what is actually covered under each? Our objective is to untangle it all and show how to achieve a complete risk management picture. To achieve complete holistic risk management, we have to put together a hierarchy of coverages for various exposures, perils, and hazards—each may appear in one or another policy—as shown in <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch11_s00_f01">Figure 11.1 "Links between Property Risks and Insurance Contracts"</a> (see the shaded risk pieces of the puzzle that indicate property or first-party-type risks applicable to this chapter). In addition to understanding this hierarchy, we need to have a vision of the future. E-commerce risk, considered one of the emerging risks, is explored in this chapter. Hazards derived from global exposure are other important risks that receive special attention in this chapter.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Learning Objectives</h3>
        <p class="para" id="baranoff-ch11_s01_p01">In this section we elaborate on the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="baranoff-ch11_s01_l01">
            <li>How insurable property is classified</li>
            <li>The ways in which valuation, deductibles, and coinsurance clauses influence property coverage and premiums</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s01_p02">Property can be classified in a number of ways, including its mobility, use value, and ownership. Sometimes these varying characteristics affect potential losses, which in turn affect decisions about which risk management options work best. A discussion of these classifying characteristics, including consideration of the hot topic of electronic commerce (e-risk) exposures and global property exposures, follows.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s01_p03"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Physical property</a><span class="glossdef">Consists of real or personal property.</span></span> generally is categorized as either real or personal. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Real property</a><span class="glossdef">Permanent structures (realty) that if removed would alter the functioning of the property.</span></span> represents permanent structures (realty) that if removed would alter the functioning of the property. Any building, therefore, is real property. In addition, built-in appliances, fences, and other such items typically are considered real property.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s01_p04">Physical property that is mobile (not permanently attached to something else) is considered <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">personal property</a><span class="glossdef">Physical property that is mobile (not permanently attached to something else).</span></span>. Included in this category are motorized vehicles, furniture, business inventory, clothing, and similar items. Thus, a house is real property, while a stereo and a car are personal property. Some property, such as carpeting, is not easily categorized. The risk manager needs to consider the various factors discussed below in determining how best to manage such property.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s01_p05">Why is this distinction between real and personal property relevant? One reason is that dissimilar properties are exposed to perils with dissimilar likelihoods. When flood threatens a house, the opportunities to protect it are limited. Yet the threat of flood damage to something mobile may be thwarted by movement of the item away from flood waters. For example, you may be able to drive your car out of the exposed area and to move your clothes to higher ground.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s01_p06">A second reason to distinguish between real and personal property is that appropriate valuation mechanisms may differ between the two. We will discuss later in this chapter the concepts of actual cash value and replacement cost new. Because of moral hazard issues, an insurer may prefer to value personal property at actual cash value (a depreciated amount). The amount of depreciation on real property, however, may outweigh concerns about moral hazard. Because of the distinction, valuation often varies between personal and real property.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s01_p07">When property is physically damaged or lost, the cost associated with being unable to use that property may go beyond the physical loss. Indirect loss and business interruption losses discussed in the box “Business Interruption with and without Direct Physical Loss” provides a glimpse into the impact of this coverage on businesses and the importance of the appropriate wording in the policies. In many cases, only loss of use of property that is directly damaged leads to coverage; in other cases, the loss of property itself is not a prerequisite to trigger loss of use coverage. As a student in this field, you will become aware of the importance of the exact meaning of the words in the insurance policy.</p>
    <div class="section" id="baranoff-ch11_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">General Property Coverage</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s01_s01_p01">The first <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">standard fire policy (SFP)</a><span class="glossdef">The generally accepted method of insuring against property loss due to fire until being replaced by homeowners policies and commercial insurance options.</span></span> came into effect during the late 1800s and came to be described as the generally accepted manner of underwriting for property loss due to fire. Two revisions of the SFP were made in 1918 and 1943. Most recently, the SFP has largely been removed from circulation, replaced by homeowners policies for residential property owners, discussed in <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch01#baranoff-ch01">Chapter 1 "The Nature of Risk: Losses and Opportunities"</a>, and the commercial package policy (CPP), featured in <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch01#baranoff-ch01">Chapter 1 "The Nature of Risk: Losses and Opportunities"</a>. The SFP was simple and relatively clear. Most of its original provisions are still found in current policies, updated for the needs of today’s insured. In light of the changes regarding terrorism exclusion that occurred after September 11, 2001 (discussed in <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch01#baranoff-ch01">Chapter 1 "The Nature of Risk: Losses and Opportunities"</a>), the topic of standard fire policies came under review. The issue at hand is that, under current laws, standard fire policies cannot exclude fires resulting from terrorism or nuclear attacks without legislative intervention.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn11_001">For more information, read the article “Standard Fire Policy Dates Back to 19th Century,” featured in <em class="emphasis">Best’s Review</em>, April 2002.</span></p>

            <h3 class="title">Business Interruption with and without Direct Physical Loss</h3>
            <p class="para" id="baranoff-ch11_s01_s01_p02">When there is a direct physical loss, insurance coverage for business interruption is more likely to exist than when the interruption is not from direct physical loss. The New Orleans hotels that suffered damage due to flooding and wind caused by Hurricane Katrina on August 30, 2005, are more likely to have had business interruption coverage. The oil industry, including its refineries and rigs that were shut down as both hurricanes Katrina and Rita ripped through the Gulf Coast, also had insurance coverage for business interruption. The stop in oil production was associated with a physical loss. Not all business interruptions are covered by insurance. The economic losses suffered by many New York businesses during the New York City transportation strike of December 2005 were not a direct loss from physical damage. As such, these businesses did not have insurance to cover the losses. Nonrelated causes of loss that affect the continued viability of businesses usually do not have insurance remedies. The avian flu pandemic is expected to disrupt many businesses’ activities indirectly. Employees are expected to be afraid to show up for work, and some industries—such as shipping—will be vulnerable. A key problem in these cases would be lack of insurance coverage.</p>
            <p class="para" id="baranoff-ch11_s01_s01_p03">In the past, some policyholders submitted business-interruption claims for nondirect economic loss. They were not successful in court. A case in point is the lawsuit filed in August 2002 by the luxury hotel chain Wyndham International against half a dozen of its insurers and the brokerage firm Marsh &amp; McLennan. Wyndham claimed that it had suffered $44 million in lost revenue following the terrorist acts of September 11, 2001, and that the insurers had acted in bad faith in failing to pay the corporation’s business-interruption claims. The Wyndham properties that reported September 11-related losses included hotels in Chicago and Philadelphia and three Puerto Rico beach resorts. Wyndham owns no properties in downtown New York City.</p>
            <p class="para" id="baranoff-ch11_s01_s01_p04">September 11 was the wake-up call. It’s estimated that some $10 billion in claims have been filed for business-interruption losses, much of them far away from Ground Zero. With the Federal Aviation Administration—ordered closing of airports nationwide, the travel industry bore major losses. Resort hotels like Wyndham’s saw business fall dramatically.</p>
            <p class="para" id="baranoff-ch11_s01_s01_p05">Are losses recoverable if the business sustained no physical damage? It depends, of course, on the policy. Most small and midsize businesses have commercial policies based on standard forms developed by the Insurance Services Office (ISO). The ISO’s customary phrase is that the suspension of business to which the income loss relates must be caused by “direct physical loss of or damage to property at the premises described in the Declarations.” Larger companies often have custom-written manuscript policies that may not be so restrictive. Whatever the wording is, it is likely to be debated in court.</p>

            <h3 class="title">From Coast to Coast: Who Is Responsible for Earthquake and Flood Losses?</h3>
            <p class="para" id="baranoff-ch11_s01_s01_p06">No region of the United States is safe from environmental catastrophes. Floods and flash floods, the most common of all natural disasters, occur in every state. The Midwest’s designated Tornado Alley ranges from Texas to the Dakotas, though twisters feel free to land just about anywhere. The Pacific Rim states of Hawaii, Alaska, Washington, Oregon, and California are hosts to volcanic activity, most famously the May 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in southwestern Washington, which took the lives of more than fifty-eight people. California is also home to the San Andreas Fault, whose seismic movements have caused nine major earthquakes in the past one hundred years; the January 1994 Northridge quake was the most costly in U.S. history, causing an estimated $20 billion in total property damage. (By comparison, the famous San Francisco earthquake of 1906 caused direct losses of $24 million, which would be about $10 billion in today’s dollars.) Along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts, <em class="emphasis">natural disaster</em> means hurricanes. Insurers paid out more money for Hurricane Katrina in 2005 than they collected in premiums in twenty-five years from Louisiana insureds. California insurers paid out more in Northridge claims than they had collected in earthquake premiums over the previous thirty years. The year 2005 saw an unprecedented number of losses because of hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. The record number of hurricanes included twenty-seven named storms. The insured losses from Hurricane Katrina alone were estimated between $40 and $60 billion, while the economic losses were estimated to be more than $100 billion. Theses losses are the largest catastrophic losses in U.S. history, surpassing Hurricane Andrew’s record cost to the industry of $20.9 billion in 2004 dollars. This record also surpasses the worst human-made catastrophe of September 11, 2001, which stands at $34.7 billion in losses in 2004 dollars.</p>
            <p class="para" id="baranoff-ch11_s01_s01_p07">Fearing that the suffering housing, construction, and related industries would impair economic growth, state government stepped in. The state-run California Earthquake Authority was established in 1996 to provide coverage to residential property owners in high-risk areas. Disaster insurance then went to the federal level. In the aftermath of Katrina, in December 2005, a proposal for a national catastrophe insurance program was pushed by four big state regulators during the National Insurance Commissioners meeting in Chicago. The idea was to change the exclusion in the policies and allow for flood coverage, while calling for a private-state-federal partnership to fund megacatastrophe losses and the creation of a new all-perils homeowners policy that would cover the cost of flood losses.</p>
            <p class="simpara">Questions for Discussion</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist" id="baranoff-ch11_s01_s01_l01">
                <li>Lee is in favor of government-supported disaster reinsurance because it encourages economic growth and development. Chris believes that it encourages overgrowth and overdevelopment in environmentally fragile areas. Whose argument do you support?</li>
                <li>The Gulf Coast town you live in has passed a building code requiring that new beachfront property be built on stilts. If your house is destroyed by a hurricane, rebuilding it on stilts will cost an extra $25,000. The standard homeowners policy excludes costs caused by ordinance or laws regulating the construction of buildings. Is this fair? Who should pay the extra expense?</li>
                <li>Jupiter Island, located off the coast of south Florida, is the wealthiest town in the country. Its 620 year-round residents earn an average of just over $200,000 per year, per person. Thus, a typical household of two adults, two children, a housekeeper, a gardener/chauffeur, and a cook boasts an annual income of some $1.4 million. What is the reasoning for subsidizing hurricane insurance for residents of Jupiter Island?</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Types of Property Coverage and Determination of Payments</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s01_s02_p01">Once it is determined that a covered peril has caused a covered loss to covered property, several other policy provisions are invoked to calculate the covered amount of compensation. As noted earlier, the topic of covered perils is very important. Catastrophes such as earthquakes are not considered covered perils for private insurance, but in many cases catastrophes such as hurricanes and other weather-related catastrophes are covered. The box <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch11_s01_s01_n02">Note 11.7 "From Coast to Coast: Who Is Responsible for Earthquake and Flood Losses?"</a> is designed to stimulate discussions about the payment of losses caused by catastrophes. Important provisions in this calculation are the valuation clause, deductibles, and coinsurance.</p>
        <div class="section" id="baranoff-ch11_s01_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Valuation Clause</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s01_s02_s01_p01">The intent of insurance is to indemnify an insured. Payment on an actual cash value basis is most consistent with the indemnity principle, as discussed in <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch09#baranoff-ch09">Chapter 9 "Fundamental Doctrines Affecting Insurance Contracts"</a>. Yet the deduction of depreciation can be both severe and misunderstood. In response, property insurers often offer coverage on a replacement cost new (RCN) basis, which does not deduct depreciation in valuing the loss.

            <h2 class="title editable block">Deductibles</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s01_s02_s02_p01">The cost of insurance to cover frequent losses (as experienced by many property exposures) is high. To alleviate the financial strain of frequent small losses, many insurance policies include a deductible. A deductible requires the insured to bear some portion of a loss before the insurer is obligated to make any payment. The purpose of deductibles is to reduce costs for the insurer, thus making lower premiums possible. The insurer saves in three ways. First, the insurer is not responsible for the entire loss. Second, because most losses are small, the number of claims for loss payment is reduced, thereby reducing the claims processing costs. Third, the moral and morale hazards are lessened because there is greater incentive to prevent loss when the insured bears part of the burden.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn11_002">For example, residents of a housing development had full coverage for windstorm losses (that is, no deductible). Their storm doors did not latch properly, so wind damage to such doors was common. The insurer paid an average of $100 for each loss. After doing so for about six months, it added a $50 deductible to the policies as they were renewed. Storm door losses declined markedly when insureds were required to pay for the first $50 of each loss.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s01_s02_s02_p02">The small, frequent losses associated with property exposures are good candidates for deductibles because their frequency minimizes risk (the occurrence of a small loss is nearly certain) and their small magnitude makes retention affordable. The most common forms of deductibles in property insurance are the following:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s01_s02_s02_l01">
                <li>Straight deductible</li>
                <li>Franchise deductible</li>
                <li>Disappearing deductible</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s01_s02_s02_p03">A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">straight deductible</a><span class="glossdef">One that requires payment for all losses less than a specified dollar amount.</span></span> requires payment for all losses less than a specified dollar amount. For example, if you have a $200 deductible on the collision coverage part of your auto policy, you pay the total amount of any loss that does not exceed $200. In addition, you pay $200 of every loss in excess of that amount. If you have a loss of $800, therefore, you pay $200 and the insurer pays $600.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s01_s02_s02_p04">A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">franchise deductible</a><span class="glossdef">One that pays the entire amount in full once the amount of loss equals the deductible.</span></span> is similar to a straight deductible, except that once the amount of loss equals the deductible, the entire loss is paid in full. This type of deductible is common in ocean marine cargo insurance, although it is stated as a percentage of the value insured rather than a dollar amount. The franchise deductible is also used in crop hail insurance, which provides that losses less than, for example, 5 percent of the crop are not paid, but when a loss exceeds that percentage, the entire loss is paid.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s01_s02_s02_p05">The major disadvantage with the franchise deductible from the insurer’s point of view is that the insured is encouraged to inflate a claim that falls just short of the amount of the deductible. If the claims adjuster says that your crop loss is 4 percent, you may argue long and hard to get the estimate up to 5 percent. Because it invites moral hazard, a franchise deductible is appropriate only when the insured is unable to influence or control the amount of loss, such as in ocean marine cargo insurance.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s01_s02_s02_p06">The disappearing deductible is a modification of the franchise deductible. Instead of having one cut-off point beyond which losses are paid in full, a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">disappearing deductible</a><span class="glossdef">One whose amount decreases as the amount of the loss increases.</span></span> is a deductible whose amount decreases as the amount of the loss increases. For example, let’s say that the deductible is $500 to begin with; as the loss increases, the deductible amount decreases. This is illustrated in <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch11_s01_s02_s02_t01">Table 11.1 "How the Disappearing Deductible Disappears"</a>.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s01_s02_s02_p07">At one time, homeowners policies had a disappearing deductible. Unfortunately, it took only a few years for insureds to learn enough about its operation to recognize the benefit of inflating claims. As a result, it was replaced by the straight deductible.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s01_s02_s02_p08">The small, frequent nature of most direct property losses makes deductibles particularly important. Deductibles help maintain reasonable premiums because they eliminate administrative expenses of the low-value, common losses. In addition, the nature of property losses causes the cost of property insurance per dollar of coverage to decline with the increasing percentage of coverage on the property. That is, the first 10 percent value of the property insurance is more expensive than the second (and so on) percent value. The cost of property insurance follows this pattern because most property losses are small, and so the expected loss does not increase in the same proportion as the increased percentage of the property value insured.</p>

It makes sense that if insurance coverage is less than the value of the property, losses will not be paid in full because the premiums charged are for lower values. For property insurance, as long as coverage is at least 80 percent of the value of the property, the property is considered fully covered under the coinsurance provision.</p>

Nothing happens until you have a partial loss. At that time, you are subject to a penalty. Suppose in January you bought an $80,000 policy for a building with an actual cash value of $100,000, and the policy has an 80 percent coinsurance clause, which requires at least 80 percent of the value to be covered in order to receive the actual loss. By the time the building suffers a $10,000 loss in November, its actual cash value has increased to $120,000. The coinsurance limit is calculated as follows:</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s02_s01_s01_p01">Companies have rapidly become dependent on computers. When a company’s computer system is down, regardless of the cause, the company risks losing weeks, months, or possibly years of data. Businesses store the majority of their information on computers. Customer databases, contact information, supplier information, order forms, and almost all documents a company uses to conduct business are stored on the computer system. Losses from theft of proprietary information, sabotage of data networks, or telecom eavesdropping can cause major losses to the infrastructure base of a business, whether it is done by outside hackers or by insider disgruntled employees.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s02_s01_s02_p01">Another risk companies face in the cyber world is the rapid advancement of technology. When a company updates its computer system, its software package, or the process for conducting business using the computer system, business is interrupted while employees learn how to conduct business using the new system. The result of this downtime is lost revenue.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s02_s01_s03_p01">Almost as quickly as the Internet is growing, the government is adding and changing applicable e-commerce laws. In the past, there were few laws because the Internet was not fully explored nor fully understood, but now, laws and regulations are mounting. Thus, companies engaged in e-commerce face legal risks arising from governmental involvement. An example of a law that is likely to change is the tax-free Internet sale. There is no sales tax imposed on merchants (and hence the consumer) on Internet sales between states partly because the government has not yet determined how states should apportion the tax revenue. As the volume of online purchases increases, so do the consequences of lost sales tax revenue from e-commerce.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s02_s01_s03_p02">Lack of qualified lawyers to handle cases that arise out of e-commerce disputes is another new risk. There are many areas of e-law that lawyers are not yet specialized in. Not only are laws complex and tedious, they are also changing rapidly. As a result, it is difficult for lawyers to stay abreast of each law that governs and regulates cyberspace.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Legal Risk</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s03_s01_p01">Often, the decision to undertake operations in a particular country is made apart from any risk management considerations. Although the legal environment may have been carefully reviewed from the standpoint of firm operations, little information may have been obtained about insurance requirements and regulations. For example, in many countries, social insurance is much broader than in the United States and there are few, if any, alternatives available to the risk manager. The risk manager may be forced by regulations to purchase local coverage that is inadequate in covered perils or limits of liability. Particularly in less-developed countries, there simply may not be adequate insurance capacity to provide desirable amounts and types of coverage. The risk manager then must decide whether or not to ignore the regulations and use nonadmitted coverage.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s03_s01_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Nonadmitted coverage</a><span class="glossdef">Contracts issued by a company not authorized to write insurance in the country where a risk exposure is located.</span></span> involves contracts issued by a company not authorized to write insurance in the country where a risk exposure is located. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Admitted insurance</a><span class="glossdef">Contracts written by companies authorized to write insurance in the country where a risk exposure is located.</span></span> is written by companies authorized to write insurance in the country where a risk exposure is located. Nonadmitted contracts have advantages to some U.S. policyholders: they are written in English; use U.S. dollars for premiums and claims, thus avoiding exchange rate risk; utilize terms and conditions familiar to U.S. risk managers; and provide flexibility in underwriting. However, such contracts may be illegal in some countries, and the local subsidiary may be subject to penalties if the contracts’ existence becomes known. Further, premium payment may not be tax deductible, even in countries where nonadmitted coverage is permitted. If nonadmitted insurance is purchased where it is prohibited, claim payments must be made to the parent corporation, which then has to find a way to transfer the funds to the local subsidiary.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s03_s01_p03">Coverage is also affected by the codification of the legal system in the other countries. The Napoleonic code, for example, is used in France, Belgium, Egypt, Greece, Italy, Spain, and several other countries. Under this legal system, liability for negligence is not treated in the same way as liability is treated under the United States system of common law; any negligence not specifically mentioned in the code is dismissed. The common law system is based on legal precedence, and the judges play a much more significant role.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="baranoff-ch11_s03_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Data Risk</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s03_s02_p01">Another problem facing the international risk manager is the collection of adequate statistical information. Economic and statistical data commonly available in the United States may simply be nonexistent in other parts of the world. For example, census data providing an accurate reflection of mortality rates may not be available. Even in industrialized countries, statistics may need careful scrutiny because the method used to produce them may be vastly different from that typical to the risk manager’s experience. This is particularly true of rate-making data. Data may also be grossly distorted for political reasons. Officially stated inflation rates, for instance, are notoriously suspect in many countries.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s03_s02_p02">Faced with this lack of reliable information, the risk manager has little choice but to proceed with caution until experience and internal data collection can supplement or confirm other data sources. Contacts with other firms in the same industry and with other foreign subsidiaries can provide invaluable sources of information.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s03_s02_p03">Data collection and analysis are a problem not only in this broad sense. Communication between the corporate headquarters and foreign operations becomes difficult due to language barriers, cultural differences, and often a sense of antagonism about a noncitizen’s authority to make decisions. Particularly difficult under these circumstances are the identification and evaluation of exposures and the implementation of risk management tools. Loss control, for instance, is much more advanced and accepted in the United States than in most other countries. Encouraging foreign operations to install sprinklers, implement safety programs, and undertake other loss-control steps is generally quite difficult. Further, risk managers of U.S.-based multinational firms may have difficulty persuading foreign operations to accept retention levels as high as those used in the United States. Retention simply is not well accepted elsewhere.</p>

    <div class="section" id="baranoff-ch11_s03_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Currency Risk</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s03_s03_p01">Any multinational transaction, where payments are transferred from one currency to another, is subject to exchange rate risk. Under the current system of floating exchange rates, the rate of currency exchange between any two countries is not fixed and may vary substantially over time. Currency exchange risk is in the area of liquidity and convertibility between currencies. The risk exposure is the inability of the global firm to exchange the currency and transfer out of hostile countries. How this kind of risk can be mitigated is explained in <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch05#baranoff-ch05">Chapter 5 "The Evolution of Risk Management: Enterprise Risk Management"</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="baranoff-ch11_s03_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Cultural Differences Risk</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s03_s04_p01">As we are very acutely aware after the September 11, 2001, attacks, cultural differences are at the root of much of the trouble around the world. But this is not only in hostile events. When a business expands abroad, one of the first actions is the study of the local culture of doing business. If you ever were in the market in old Jerusalem, you may have experienced the differences in shopping. You learn very quickly that a merchant never expects you to buy the item for the quoted price. The haggling may take a long time. You may leave and come back before you buy the item you liked for less than half the originally quoted price. This is the culture. You are expected to bargain and negotiate. Another cultural difference is the “connection” or “protection.” Many business moves will never happen without the right connection with the right people in power.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s03_s04_p02">Labor laws reflect another interesting cultural difference. In some countries, it is common to employ very young children—an act that is against the law in the United States. The families in these countries depend heavily on the income of their children. But an American business in such a country may be faced with an ethical dilemma: should it employ children or adhere to U.S. practices and labor laws?<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn11_019">Etti G. Baranoff and Phyllis S. Myers, “Ethics in Insurance,” Academy of Insurance Education, Washington, D.C., instructional video with supplemental study guide (video produced by the Center for Video Education, 1997.)</span> Islamic finance is very different from finance in the Western world; for example, in Islam, interest payments are not permitted. With the expanded involvement of many businesses in the Middle East and Islamic countries, many academics, as well as businesspeople, are learning about the special ways to conduct business there.</p>

    <div class="section" id="baranoff-ch11_s03_s05">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Global Risk Management</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s03_s05_p01">The steps in global risk management include processes to reduce risk and develop loss-control policies, along with obtaining the appropriate insurance. <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch11_s03_t01">Table 11.2 "Ten Ways to Tune Up Management of Political Risks"</a> lists ways to manage political risks. The steps include learning the culture of the country and becoming a good corporate citizen, learning about the reality of the country, and finding ways to avoid political and legal traps. In the area of insurance, the global firm first looks for public insurance policies. The U.S. government established an insurance program administered through the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) in 1948. The types of coverage available include expropriation, confiscation, war risks, civil strife, unfair calling of guarantees, contract repudiation, and currency inconvertibility. These are shown in <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch11_s03_t01">Table 11.2 "Ten Ways to Tune Up Management of Political Risks"</a>. OPIC insurance is available only in limited amounts and only in certain developing countries that have signed bilateral trade agreements with the United States for projects intended to aid development. Some private insurers, however, also provide political risk insurance. Private insurers do not have the same restrictions as OPIC, but country limits do exist to avoid catastrophe (dependent exposure units). Additional types of coverage, such as kidnap, ransom, and export license cancellation, are also provided by private insurers. Poor experience in this line of insurance has made coverage more difficult and costly to obtain.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s03_s05_p02">After September 11, some insurers pulled out of the political risk market, while others took the opportunity to expand their global coverage offerings. A Canadian insurer reported that the demand for insurance for employee political risk and kidnap and ransom for a dozen global companies increased by 100 percent.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn11_020">Daniel Hays, “Insurer Finds Good Market in Political Risk,” <em class="emphasis">National Underwriter Online News Service</em>, November 28, 2001.</span> Zurich North America and Chubb expanded their political risk insurance offerings to the Asian market.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn11_021">“Zurich North America Expands Political Risk Insurance to Asian Market,” <em class="emphasis">National Underwriter Online News Service</em>, April 6, 2002; John Jennings, “Political Risk Cover Demand Surges: Insurers,” <em class="emphasis">National Underwriter</em>, Property &amp; Casualty/Risk &amp; Benefits Management Edition, April 27, 1998.</span> The private insurance market’s ability to meet the demand has been strengthening each year because customers require broader coverage with longer terms, up to ten years. Other companies expanding into the market are Bermuda’s Sovereign Risk, AIG, and Reliance, among others.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s03_s05_p03">Until recently, long-term political risk insurance was available mostly from international government agencies such as the Washington-based Multilateral Investment Guarantee Corporation (MIGA), a member of the World Bank Group; OPIC; the United Kingdom’s Export Credit Guarantee Department; and the French government’s export credit agency, Coface. But now the private market has been competing in the longer-term coverages and has opened coverage to losses caused by war and currency inconvertibility. Capacity and limits increased as reinsurance became more readily available in this area of global risks. Lloyd’s of London, for example, offered about $100 million in limits in 2002, a huge increase from the $10 million it could provide in 1992, according to Investment Insurance International, the specialist political risk division of Aon Group. AIG has increased its limits to $30 million per risk, while the rest of the private market had about $55 million to work with.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s03_s05_p04">Coverage is even available in Israel, where major concerns about security made investors and businesspeople nervous. A political risk team at Lloyd’s (MAP Underwriting) developed a policy to address those concerns.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn11_022">“Armed-Conflict Risks Covered,” <em class="emphasis">National Underwriter, Property &amp; Casualty/Risk &amp; Benefits Management Edition</em>, June 11, 2001. Many Internet sites deal with global risk. For example, Global Risk International at <a class="link" href="http://www.globalrisk.uk.com/">http://www.globalrisk.uk.com/</a> offers counterterrorist training, kidnap and ransom management, close protection, and surveillance.</span> The policy gives peace of mind to businesses that believe in the economic future of Israel by protecting the effects of “war and other political violence on their investments, property and personnel.” This specific coverage includes acts of war.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s03_s05_p05">As noted in <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch11_s03_t01">Table 11.2 "Ten Ways to Tune Up Management of Political Risks"</a>, some global firms use captives for this exposure. Captives were discussed in <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch06#baranoff-ch06">Chapter 6 "The Insurance Solution and Institutions"</a>.</p>
