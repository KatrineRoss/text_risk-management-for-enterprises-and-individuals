<span class="title-prefix">Chapter 23</span> Cases in Holistic Risk Management</h1>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_p01">By this point, you have gained an understanding of the life cycle risks associated with mortality, longevity, and health/disability. You have learned about the social insurance programs such as Social Security and Medicare that help counter these risks. We have delved into life, health, and disability insurance products in <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch19#baranoff-ch19">Chapter 19 "Mortality Risk Management: Individual Life Insurance and Group Life Insurance"</a>   and <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch22#baranoff-ch22">Chapter 22 "Employment and Individual Health Risk Management"</a> and discussed pensions in <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch21#baranoff-ch21">Chapter 21 "Employment-Based and Individual Longevity Risk Management"</a>. The availability and features of these products in group (employer-sponsored) or individual arrangements were also discussed. On the property/casualty side, we covered all the risks confronted by families and enterprises. We discussed the solutions using insurance for the home, automobile, and liability risks. Thus, you now have the tools needed to complete the holistic risk puzzle and the steps representing each layer of the risk management pyramid, from society on up to you as an individual.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_p02">With that said, this chapter is a departure from most, but it is vitally important. Our final lesson focuses on applying your knowledge and skills in the complete holistic risk management picture. In other words, you will now learn how to use your new tools. Practical case studies featuring hypothetical families and companies—some designed by fellow students—are utilized to fulfill this objective. The situations posed by these cases are ones that you may encounter in the roles you serve throughout your life, and they incorporate the insurance products and risk management techniques discussed throughout this text.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_p03">We begin first with a sample family risk management portfolio involving home, auto, life, health, and disability insurance coverage and planning for retirement. This case is for the personal needs of families. The second case focuses on the employer’s provided employee benefits package. It is designed as the benefits handbook of a hypothetical employer who provides more benefit options than current practices. In the last case, we broaden our understanding of enterprise risk management (covered in Part I of the text) by exploring the concept of alternative risk financing and the challenges faced by a risk manager in selecting among insurance products for commercial risk management needs.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_p04">At the conclusion of this chapter, your knowledge of risk management concepts will be reinforced and expanded. The chapter is structured as follows:</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Losses Paid to Hypothetical Victims’ Families</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s00_s01_p01">To understand the spectrum of personal losses to the families, we introduce two hypothetical families who were directly affected by the World Trade Center catastrophe. The families are those of Allen Zang, who worked as a bond trader in the South Tower of the World Trade Center, and his high school friend Mike Shelling, a graduate student who visited Allen on the way to a job interview. Both Mike and Allen were thirty-four years old and married. Mike had a six-year-old boy and Allen had three young girls.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s00_s01_p02">Both Allen and Mike were among the casualties of the attack on the World Trade Center. But their eligibility for benefits was considerably different because Mike was not employed at the time. In the analysis of the losses or benefits paid to each family, we will first evaluate the benefits available under the social insurance programs mandated in the United States and in New York. Second, we will evaluate the benefits available under the group insurance programs and pensions provided by employers. Third, we will evaluate the private insurance programs purchased by the families (as shown in <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch23_s00_s01_f01">Figure 23.1 "Structure of Insurance Coverages"</a>). We will also evaluate the ways that families might attempt to collect benefits from negligent parties who may have contributed to the losses.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s00_s01_p03">Recall from <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch18#baranoff-ch18">Chapter 18 "Social Security"</a> that social insurance programs include Social Security, workers’ compensation, and unemployment compensation insurance (and, in a few states, state-provided disability insurance). In the United States, these programs are intended to protect members of the work force and are not based on need. The best-known aspect of Social Security is the mandatory plan for retirement (so-called old-age benefits). But the program also includes disability benefits; survivors’ benefits; and Medicare parts A, B, C, and D.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s00_s01_p04"><a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch23_s00_s01_t01">Table 23.1 "Benefits for Two Hypothetical Losses of Lives"</a> shows the benefits available to each of the families. It is important to note that both Mike and Allen were employed for at least ten years (forty quarters). Therefore, they were fully insured for Social Security benefits, and their families were eligible to receive survivors’ benefits under Social Security. Each family received the allotted $255 burial benefit. Also, because both had young children, the families were eligible for a portion of the fathers’ Primary Insurance Amount (PIA). The Social Security Administration provided the benefits immediately without official death certificates, as described by Commissioner Larry Massanari in his report to the House Committee on Ways and Means, Subcommittee on Social Security.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn23_001">Social Security Testimony Before Congress, “House Committee on Ways and Means, Subcommittee on Social Security (Shaw) on SSA’s Response to the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, Larry Massanari, Commissioner,” <a class="link" href="http://www.ssa.gov/legislation/testimony_110101.html">http://www.ssa.gov/legislation/testimony_110101.html</a> (accessed April 16, 2009).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s00_s01_p05">You learned in <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch16#baranoff-ch16">Chapter 16 "Risks Related to the Job: Workers’ Compensation and Unemployment Compensation"</a>   that workers’ compensation provides medical coverage, disability income, rehabilitation, and survivors’ income (death benefits). Benefits are available only if the injury or death occurred on the job or as a result of the job. Because Allen was at the office at the time of his death, his family was eligible to receive survivors’ benefits from the workers’ compensation carrier of the employer.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s00_s01_p06">The New York Workers’ Compensation Statute states, “If the worker dies from a compensable injury, the surviving spouse and/or minor children, and lacking such, other dependents as defined by law, are entitled to weekly cash benefits. The amount is equal to two-thirds of the deceased worker’s average weekly wage for the year before the accident. The weekly compensation may not exceed the weekly maximum, despite the number of dependents. If there are no surviving children, spouse, grandchildren, grandparents, brothers, or sisters entitled to compensation, the surviving parents or the estate of the deceased worker may be entitled to payment of a sum of $50,000. Funeral expenses may also be paid, up to $6,000 in Metropolitan New York counties; up to $5,000 in all others.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s00_s01_p07">The maximum benefit at the time of the catastrophe was $400 per week, less any Social Security benefits, for lifetime or until remarriage.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn23_002">Daniel Hays, “Workers’ Compensation Losses Might Top $1 Billion,” <em class="emphasis">National Underwriter</em>, Property &amp; Casualty/Risk &amp; Benefits Management Edition, September 2001, 10; See also New York State Workers’ Compensation Board at <a class="link" href="http://www.wcb.state.ny.us/">http://www.wcb.state.ny.us/</a> (accessed April 16, 2009).</span> Thus, Allen’s family received the workers’ compensation benefits minus the Social Security amount. Recall from <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch16#baranoff-ch16">Chapter 16 "Risks Related to the Job: Workers’ Compensation and Unemployment Compensation"</a>   that under the workers’ compensation system, the employee’s family gives up the right to sue the employer. Allen’s family could not sue his employer, but Mike’s family, not having received workers’ compensation benefits, may believe that Allen’s employer was negligent in not providing a safe place for a visitor and may sue under the employer’s general liability coverage.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s00_s01_p08">In Mike’s case, the New York Disability Benefits program did not apply because the program does not include death benefits for “non-job-injury.” If Mike were disabled rather than killed, this state program would have paid him disability benefits. Of course, unemployment compensation does not apply here either. However, it would apply to all workers who lost their jobs involuntarily as a result of a catastrophe.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s00_s01_p09">Because Allen was employed at the time, his family was also eligible to receive group benefits provided by his employer (as covered in <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch20#baranoff-ch20">Chapter 20 "Employment-Based Risk Management (General)"</a>, <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch21#baranoff-ch21">Chapter 21 "Employment-Based and Individual Longevity Risk Management"</a>, and <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch22#baranoff-ch22">Chapter 22 "Employment and Individual Health Risk Management"</a>). Many employers offer group life and disability coverage, medical insurance, and some types of pension plans or 401(k) tax-free retirement investment accounts. Allen’s employer gave twice the annual salary for basic group term life insurance and twice the annual salary for accidental death and dismemberment (AD&amp;D). The family received from the insurer death benefits in an amount equal to four times Allen’s annual salary, free from income tax (see <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch19#baranoff-ch19">Chapter 19 "Mortality Risk Management: Individual Life Insurance and Group Life Insurance"</a>   and <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch21#baranoff-ch21">Chapter 21 "Employment-Based and Individual Longevity Risk Management"</a>). Allen earned $100,000 annually; therefore, the total death benefits were $400,000, tax-free.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s00_s01_p10">Allen also elected to be covered by his employer’s group short-term disability (STD) and long-term disability (LTD) plans. Those plans included supplemental provisions giving a small amount of death benefits. In the case of Allen, the amount was $30,000. In addition, his employer provided a defined contribution plan, and the accumulated account balance was available to his beneficiary. The accumulated amount in Allen’s 401(k) account was also available to his beneficiary.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s00_s01_p11">Mike’s family could not take advantage of group benefits because he was not employed. Therefore, no group life or group STD and LTD were available to Mike’s family. However, his pension accounts from former employers and any individual retirement accounts (IRAs) were available to his beneficiary.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s00_s01_p12">Survivors’ medical insurance was a major concern. Allen’s wife did not work and the family had medical coverage from Allen’s employer. Allen’s wife decided to continue the health coverage the family had from her husband’s employer under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) of 1986. The law provided for continuation of health insurance up to 36 months to the wife as a widow for the whole cost of the coverage (both the employee and the employer’s cost) plus 2 percent (as covered in <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch22#baranoff-ch22">Chapter 22 "Employment and Individual Health Risk Management"</a>).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s00_s01_p13">For Mike’s family, the situation was different because Mike was in graduate school. His wife covered the family under her employer’s health coverage. She simply continued this coverage.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s00_s01_p14">The third layer of available coverage is personal insurance programs. Here, the families’ personal risk management comes into play. When Mike decided to return to school, he and his wife consulted with a reputable financial planner who helped them in their risk management and financial planning. Mike had made a series of successful career moves. In his last senior position at an Internet start-up company, he was able to cash in his stock options and create a sizeable investment account for his family. Also, just before beginning graduate school, Mike purchased a $1 million life insurance policy on his life and $500,000 on his wife’s life. They decided to purchase a twenty-year level term life rather than a universal life policy (for details, refer to <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch19#baranoff-ch19">Chapter 19 "Mortality Risk Management: Individual Life Insurance and Group Life Insurance"</a>) because they wanted to invest some of their money in a new home and a vacation home in Fire Island (off Long Island, New York).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s00_s01_p15">The amount of insurance Mike bought for his wife was lower because she already had sizeable group life coverage under her employer’s group life insurance package. Subsequent to Mike’s death, his wife received the $1 million in death benefits within three weeks. Despite not having a death certificate, she was able to show evidence that her husband was at the World Trade Center at the time. She had a recording on her voice mail at work from Mike telling her that he was going to try to run down the stairs. The message was interrupted by the sound of the building collapsing. Thus, Mike’s beneficiaries, his wife and son, received the $1 million life insurance and the Social Security benefits available. Because the family had sizeable collateral resources (non–federal government sources), they were eligible for less than the maximum amount of the Federal Relief Fund created for the victims’ families.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s00_s01_p16">Allen’s family had not undertaken the comprehensive financial planning that Mike and his family had. He did not have additional life insurance policies, even though he planned to get to it “one of these days.” His family’s benefits were provided by his social insurance coverages and by his employer. The family was also eligible for the relief fund established by the federal government, less collateral resources.</p>

        <div class="section" id="baranoff-ch23_s00_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Losses Paid to a Hypothetical Business</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s00_s02_p01">To see how the catastrophe affected nearby businesses, we will examine a hypothetical department store called Worlding. In our scenario, Worlding is a very popular discount store, specializing in name-brand clothing, housewares, cosmetics, and linens. Four stories tall, it is located in the heart of the New York financial district just across from the World Trade Center. At 9:00 A.M. on September 11, 2001, the store had just opened its doors. At any time, shoppers would have to fight crowds in the store to get to the bargains. The morning of September 11 was no different. When American Airlines Flight 11 struck the North Tower, a murmur spread throughout the store and the customers started to run outside to see what happened. As they were looking up, they saw United Airlines Flight 175 hit the South Tower. By the time the towers collapsed, all customers and employees had fled the store and the area. Dust and building materials engulfed and penetrated the building; the windows shattered, but the structure remained standing. Because Worlding leased rather than owned the building, its only property damage was to inventory and fixtures. But renovation work, neighborhood cleanup, and safety testing kept Worlding closed—and without income—for seven months.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s00_s02_p02">The case of insurance coverage for Worlding’s losses is straightforward because the owners had a business package policy that provided both commercial property coverage and general liability. Worlding bought the Causes of Loss—Special Form, an open perils or all risk coverage form (as explained in <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch11#baranoff-ch11">Chapter 11 "Property Risk Management"</a> and <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch15#baranoff-ch15">Chapter 15 "Multirisk Management Contracts: Business"</a>). Instead of listing perils that are covered, the special form provides protection for all causes of loss not specifically excluded. Usually, most exclusions found in the special form relate to catastrophic potentials. The form did not include a terrorism exclusion. Therefore, Worlding’s inventory stock was covered in full.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s00_s02_p03">Worlding did not incur any liability losses to third parties, so all losses were covered by the commercial property coverage. Worlding provided regular inventory data to its insurer, who paid for the damages without any disputes. With its property damage and the closing of the neighborhood around the World Trade Center, Worlding had a nondisputable case of business interruption loss. Coverage for business interruption of businesses that did not have any property damage, such as tourist-dependent hotel chains and resort hotels,<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn23_003">John D. Dempsey and Lee M. Epstein, “Re-Examining Business Interruption Insurance” (part one of three), <em class="emphasis">Risk Management Magazine</em>, February 2002.</span> depended on the exact wording in their policies. Some policies were more liberal than others, an issue described in <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch15#baranoff-ch15">Chapter 15 "Multirisk Management Contracts: Business"</a>.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s00_s02_p04">Because Worlding was eligible for business income interruption coverage, the owners used adjusters to help them calculate the appropriate amount of lost income, plus expenses incurred while the business was not operational. An example of such a detailed list was provided in <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch15#baranoff-ch15">Chapter 15 "Multirisk Management Contracts: Business"</a>. The restoration of the building to Worlding’s specifications was covered under the building owners’ commercial property policy.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Importance of the Loss Cases</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s00_s03_p01">As these examples show, complete insurance is a complex maze of varying types of coverage. This introduction is designed to provide a glimpse into the full scope of insurance that affects the reader as an individual or as a business operator. In our business case, if Worlding had not had business insurance, its employees would have been without a job to return to. Thus, the layer of the business coverage is as important in an introductory risk and insurance course as are all aspects of your personal and employment-related insurance coverages.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s00_s03_p02">In addition, emphasis is given to the structure of the insurance industry and its type of coverage and markets. Emphasis is given to the new concept of considering all risks in an organization (enterprise risk management), not just those risks whose losses are traditionally covered by insurance.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s00_s03_p03">The text has been designed to show you, the student, the width and variety of the field of risk management and insurance. At this stage, the pieces needed for holistic risk management now connect. As noted above, current events and their risk management outcomes have been clarified for you, whether the losses are to households or businesses. Furthermore, you now have the basic tools to build efficient and holistic risk management portfolios for yourself, your family, and your business.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s01_s01_p01">The purpose of this project is to build a portfolio of risk management and insurance coverages for a hypothetical family. This report is typical of those produced by students as a group project in the author’s risk and insurance classes. The students present sections of the types of coverage they design throughout the semester and submit the complete project at the end of the semester as part of their final grade. The students live the project during the semester and provide creativity along with hands-on knowledge and information about the best risk management for their fictional families. Many groups develop special relationship with helpful agents who volunteer to speak to the class. The help that agents provide receives high marks from most students.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s01_s01_p02">This report, as all the others produced by the students, considers property, auto, disability, life, health, and long-term care insurance, as well as retirement planning. The group project presented here does not involve the agent-customer relationship. Many other reports do include the relationship as a reason to buy from a specific company.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Family Description</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s01_s03_p01">John is a thirty-five-year-old nuclear engineer who has been working for Virginia Power since 1999. His wife, Karen, is a thirty-year-old homemaker. They have been married for five years. John and Karen have a nine-month-old infant named Tristian. John and Karen are in good health. They are looking forward to having another child, but Karen has high pregnancy risk. This has to be taken into consideration when selecting health insurance coverage for the family. Their annual net income is $72,000 (John’s salary of $100,000, less taxes and other deductions). They own two cars. John drives a 1996 Toyota Corolla and Karen drives a 1997 Toyota Camry. They need good insurance coverage because John is the only one who is working. All the insurance providers examined have ratings of “A” or better in A.M. Best ratings.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Homeowners Insurance</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s01_s04_s01_p01">John and Karen purchased a two-story single home for $150,000 in 1996. The house is located on 7313 Pineleaf Drive in Richmond, Virginia. The total footage is 2,014 square feet. There is a two-car attached garage. John and Karen decided not to renew their homeowners insurance with AllState Insurance because of the expensive premium and unacceptable customer service they experienced in the past. John did research on the Internet and found quotes from different companies. He was asked to give detailed information on the house. The house is located within 1,000 feet of a fire hydrant and it is one hundred feet away from a fire station. John promised to install a security system to prevent theft. Karen wanted extra protection on her precious jewelry worth $10,000, Ming china worth $5,000, and antique paintings valued at $7,000. They need scheduled personal property endorsements. Over the last five years, John and Karen’s house has appreciated by $10,000. They want to insure the home to 100 percent of its estimated replacement cost, which is $160,000, rather than 80 percent. In case of a total loss, the insurer will replace the home exactly as it was before the loss took place, even if the replacement exceeds the amount of insurance stated in the policy. <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch23_s01_s04_s01_t01">Table 23.2 "Homeowners Insurance Plan Options"</a> summarizes the coverage quoted by three insurance companies.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s01_s04_s03_p02">TransAmerica, an insurance broker that prepares coverage for Erie and Prudential Life, prepared two plans for the Smiths as shown in <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch23_s01_s04_s03_t01">Table 23.4 "Long-Term Disability Plan Options"</a>. Both plans provided benefits to age sixty-five with a ninety-day waiting period. Both plans offer the same level of optional benefits, including residual disability and an inflation rider.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s01_s04_s04_p01">The Smith family realized they needed to invest in additional term life insurance for John because his employer provided only term life coverage in the amount of one times his salary, $100,000. They did not need to worry about life insurance for Karen because her parents bought a ten-year level term coverage in the amount of $250,000 on Karen’s life when Tristian was born. They told Karen that an untimely death would mean an economic loss to the family because John would likely have to hire help for housekeeping and child care.</p>

He enjoys working out at the gym after work at least three days a week and has never been a smoker. John’s family history shows no serious health problems, and most of his relatives have lived well into their seventies.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s01_s04_s04_p03">To decide how much life insurance is needed for John, he and Karen worked on a needs analysis with some friends who are familiar with financial planning. They came to the conclusion that he will need to purchase $300,000 additional coverage. The following breakdown shows why they believe they need this amount of coverage:</p>

All of Virginia Power’s benefit coverage is provided by Anthem, a Blue Cross/Blue Shield company with A++ rating. Employees of Virginia Power and their family members are covered on the date employment begins. Benefits will be provided at the in-network level to an employee who lives outside the network’s geographic area. In-network participants must receive preventative care benefits from PPO providers.

On the third day of the vacation, John suffers chest pains while running and collapses. John is rushed by ambulance to a nearby hospital where he is diagnosed with a bronchial infection. X-rays and lab work total $300. The family pays 20 percent of the bill because they had met their deductible for the year. Their total out-of-pocket expenses for the visit are $60. Though disappointed that he can’t jog for a week or two, John is thankful that, even out of state, he is able to have expert medical care and return to his family to enjoy the remainder of his vacation.</p>

The contribution is invested in mutual funds. John’s 401(k) current balance is $32,000 and he hopes he will be able to invest it wisely.

        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s01_s06_p01">With the help from all group members working on the project, the Smith family is able to choose the best coverage they can get from various insurance plans. Their homeowners insurance is provided by Travelers Insurance Company; their auto is covered by Harford Insurance Company. They bought additional life insurance from Western-Southern Life Company and additional long-term disability from Erie. Virginia Power provides good health care coverage, term life insurance, a 401(k) retirement plan, and long-term disability. The Smith family chose insurance plans that best fit their needs.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
            <p class="para" id="baranoff-ch23_s01_s06_p02">In this section you studied how the needs of a hypothetical family affect the selection of insurance coverage and employee benefits:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="baranoff-ch23_s01_s06_l01">
                <li>Value of real and personal property, loss provisions, premiums, and deductibles, and company financial strength ratings all influence the amounts and types of homeowners coverage as well as the selection of the insurer.</li>
                <li>In the underwriting of auto insurance, insurers consider the accident history, age of the driver, market value, utility, and purpose of the vehicle.</li>
                <li>Employers may offer basic life and disability insurance benefits, but a family should consider supplemental coverage if its income is provided by a sole breadwinner.</li>
                <li>Family planning, desire for flexibility, and the overall health of family members are important considerations in the choice of health insurance.</li>
                <li>Employer-sponsored retirement options can be adequate to meet a family’s retirement needs if the family saves and invests wisely in relation to their age and expected retirement.</li>
                <li>A family needs analysis should include a family income statement including monthly income less insurance premiums, retirement savings, utility bills, and other monthly expenses to assess the feasibility of the plan.</li>

            <ol class="orderedlist" id="baranoff-ch23_s01_s06_l02">
                <li>What provision in homeowners insurance allows John and Karen to have their home replaced at 100 percent of its value rather than 80 percent?</li>
                <li>Why was the family asked to give detailed geographic information about the home when they were obtaining insurance quotes?</li>
                <li>What does it mean to schedule personal property? Why would Karen choose to do this?</li>
                <li>Why must John provide evidence of insurability for his supplemental life insurance coverage but not his basic group coverage?</li>
                <li>What does liability listed as “100,000/300,000/100,000” in the Smiths’ auto insurance policy refer to?</li>
                <li>What needs should be considered when determining the amount of life insurance coverage?</li>
                <li>Do you think the ten-year level term life insurance coverage on Karen is appropriate?</li>
                <li>What features make a PPO plan preferable to an HMO for the Smiths?</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s02_s01_p01">This case, like Case 1, is a group project that is part of employee benefits classes taught by the author of this textbook. Following is the employee benefits portfolio of a compilation of the ten groups of the fall 2002 class (and some of the fall 2000 class), in the words of the students.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn23_005">The work of the following students is reflected in this case: Donna Biddick, Lavonnia Bragg, Katrina Brand, Heather Cartes, Robert Cloud, Maria Conway, Thomas Dabney Clay, Lillian Dunlevy, Daniel Fleming, Shannon Fowlkes, Caroline Garrett, Barbara Guill, Steven Hall, Georgette Harris, Shirelle Harris, Tyron Hinton, Tiffany Jefferson, Tennille McCarter, Pamela Nicholson, Hiren Patel, Susan Shaban, Carolyn Shelburne, Gaurav Shrestha, Stephanie Soucy, Christopher Speight, Cassandra Townsend, Geoff Watkins, and Tresha White, from fall 2002. Also included is the work of Margaret Maslak and Shelisa Artis from fall 2000.</span> The case is a typical project that lasts for the students throughout the semester. The students present portions of the case as the material is covered in class. In most cases, the whole employee benefits portfolio of the hypothetical company created by the students is presented at the conclusion of the semester as part of the final grade. This case does not provide a long-term care coverage plan. Most of the retirement plans offered by the hypothetical employers of these projects are not realistic in terms of the amounts and variety. The students are requested to provide a defined benefit plan, a defined contribution plan, and a 401(k) plan in order to experience the workings of these plans. The students did not offer a complete cafeteria plan—only a flexible spending account.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn23_006">The students used information from the following companies and sources: Dominion Co., <a class="link" href="http://www.dominion.com">www.dominion.com</a>; Dominion Virginia Power, <a class="link" href="http://www.dom.com/">http://www.dom.com/</a>; Phillip Morris, USA, <a class="link" href="http://www.philipmorrisusa.com/en/cms/Home/default.aspx">http://www.philipmorrisusa.com/en/cms/Home/default.aspx</a>; Virginia Retirement System, <a class="link" href="http://www.state.va.us/vrs/vrs-home-htm">www.state.va.us/vrs/vrs-home-htm</a>; Henrico County, Virginia, <a class="link" href="http://www.co.henrico.va.us.">www.co.henrico.va.us.</a>; Minnesota Life, <a class="link" href="http://www.minnesotalife.com">www.minnesotalife.com</a>; A.

Money deposited in these accounts is not taxed when it goes into the accounts or when it is paid back to you. Employees can use these pretax dollars to pay for miscellaneous items such as eyeglasses or unreimbursed medical/dental expenses. This plan also allows employees to pay dependent care expenses with pretax dollars. Any amount not spent at the end of the plan year is forfeited by the employee (use it or lose it). See <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch23_s02_s03_s08_t01">Table 23.19 "Summary of FSA: Major Plan Provisions"</a> for details.

When you die, benefits continue to be paid to your designated beneficiary, assuming your beneficiary survives you. Written spousal consent is required before you can designate a beneficiary other than your spouse. Benefits are reduced for the survivorship option because payments will be made over two lives rather than one. Payments depend on your age and your beneficiary’s age when you begin receiving payments. If you choose the survivorship option and your beneficiary dies before you do, your payment will be increased to the amount that you would have received under the single life option. Additionally, you may choose the amount (50 percent, 75 percent, or 100 percent) your surviving beneficiary will receive after you die.</p>

Once you become a participant, we evaluate your eligible compensation (base pay, commissions, and bonuses) and the eligible compensation of all Galaxy Max employees. Your portion of the amount of profits we contribute is the proportion of your eligible compensation to that of all employees. For example, suppose that Galaxy Max will contribute $200,000 to the profit-sharing plan, your eligible compensation is $35,000, and the eligible compensation of all employees is $950,000. Your share would be $35,000/$950,000, or 3.68 percent, of $200,000. Therefore, the allocation to your account would be $7,368.42. These numbers are used only as an example.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s04_s02_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Alternative risk financing</a><span class="glossdef">Risk-funding arrangements that typically apply to losses above a firm’s primary self-insurance retentions or losses above the primary insurance layer.</span></span> (sometimes referred to as alternative risk transfer) are risk-funding arrangements that typically apply to losses that are above the primary self-insurance retentions or losses above the primary insurance layer. Because of the complexities in designing these programs, they are utilized for solving the problems of large clients, and they merit substantial premiums.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s04_s02_p02">Alternative risk transfer is an evolving area of risk finance where programs are often tailored for the individual company. Insurers have been expanding their offerings and creativity in designing methods of financing corporate risk. This new generation of financing risk is becoming more and more mainstream as more experience is gained by insurers, brokers, and risk managers.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s04_s02_p03">	An analogy between alternative medicine and alternative risk financing is made to demonstrate the importance of such insurance programs. The evolution of alternative risk transfer holds a striking parallel to that of alternative medicine. Individuals and the medical community began turning to alternative medicine when conventional methods failed. Alternative risk transfer is not much different. Risk managers looked for alternatives when the conventional insurance markets failed to satisfy their needs. When availability and affordability issues became prevalent in the insurance markets,<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn23_009">Recall the explanation of the underwriting cycles described in <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch08#baranoff-ch08">Chapter 8 "Insurance Markets and Regulation"</a> of the text. Also, remember that this case was prepared in 1996–1997 during the end tail of a long soft market condition.</span> risk managers resorted to higher retention levels and creative methods of risk financing. In this process, corporations’ risk tolerance levels increased, as did the expertise and comfort level of risk managers in managing risk. Consequently, they did not rush back into the market when it softened. Many of today’s risk managers are protecting themselves from being at the mercy of the insurance industry. A long period of softness in the 1990s also put the buyers in the driver’s seat and the buyers have been demanding products that align more closely with their company’s needs. No longer was alternative risk financing created to heal availability and affordability problems. It has also been adopted to improve cash flows and effectively handle all risks in the organization. As in alternative medicine, the new methods have been seen as viable options for the improved (financial) health of the organization.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s04_s02_p04">Risk managers began taking and maintaining long-term control of the process. They have been looking for cost, accounting, and tax efficiencies. Thus, in addition to using captives and risk retention groups (discussed in <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch06#baranoff-ch06">Chapter 6 "The Insurance Solution and Institutions"</a> and <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch08#baranoff-ch08">Chapter 8 "Insurance Markets and Regulation"</a>), they have been establishing customized finite risk programs, multiyear, multiline integrated risk programs, and they have been insuring risks that previously were once considered uninsurable. We will first delve into explaining these new-generation products before working on the LOCO case. The explanation of each program includes examples from real companies.</p>

    <div class="section" id="baranoff-ch23_s04_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Nontraditional Insurance Products: The New Generation</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s04_s03_p01">New-generation risk-financing programs have emerged in response to the needs of large and complex organizations. These new-generation products blend with an orchestrated structure of self-insurance, captives, conventional insurance, and excess limits for selected individual lines. These more sophisticated methods of financing risk are being driven by a new breed of strategic-thinking risk managers who have an increased knowledge of risk management theory. They come to the table with a good understanding of their company’s exposures and the financial resources available to handle risk. They are seeking risk-handling solutions that will improve efficiency, be cost-effective, and stabilize earnings.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s04_s03_p02">Increasingly, today’s risk managers are practicing a holistic approach to risk management in which all of the corporation’s risks—business, financial, and operational—are being assessed (as noted in <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch06#baranoff-ch06">Chapter 6 "The Insurance Solution and Institutions"</a>). This concept, sometimes referred to as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">integrated risk management</a><span class="glossdef">Coordinated alternative risk-financing approach of identifying, measuring, and monitoring diverse and multiple risks that require effective and rapid response to changing circumstances.</span></span>, is a coordinated alternative risk-financing approach of identifying, measuring, and monitoring diverse and multiple risks that require effective and rapid response to changing circumstances.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn23_010">Lucy Nottingham, “Integrated Risk Management,” <em class="emphasis">Canadian Business Review</em> 23, no. 2 (1996): 26.</span> Nontraditional risk transfer programs, combined with traditional coverages, are being used to meet the needs of this holistic and strategic risk management approach.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn23_011">Carolyn Aldred, “Alternative Financing of Primary Interest: Risk Managers Expected to Become More Familiar with Nontraditional Products,” <em class="emphasis">Business Insurance</em>, September 3, 1997.</span> Two of the nontraditional transfer programs available to risk managers that are covered in this case are integrated risk and finite insurance programs.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s04_s03_s01_s01_p01">The traditional approach of a tower of monoline coverages, each with a separate policy limit, has not been meeting the needs and operations of many corporations. Companies have been looking to integrated programs that combine lines of coverages in one aggregate policy—generally for a multiyear term. These integrated programs also go by names such as concentric risk and basket aggregates. The features that are attracting corporations to these programs include the following:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s04_s03_s01_s01_l01">
                    <li>Less administration time and cost</li>

                    <li>Elimination of the need to build a tower of coverages</li>
                    <li>One loss triggers just one policy</li>

                    <li>Elimination of the need to buy separate limits for each type of coverage</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s04_s03_s01_s01_p02">Judy Lindenmayer’s<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn23_012">Judy Lindenmayer was one of the experts contributing to the creation of this video education segment.</span> program for FMR (Fidelity Investments) was one of the earliest integrated programs. She referred to it as concentric risk. She explained how she lowered her cost through the use of an aggregate limit. Under traditional coverage, an insured may be purchasing limits that are $50 million per year, but it is unlikely that there would be a major loss every year; thus, the full limit would not be used. Therefore, there is a waste of large limits in many of the years while the insured continues to pay for them. The solution to the redundancy and the extra cost is “the integrated program, with one aggregate limit over the three-year period. You buy one $50 million limit.” Obviously, this is going to cost the insured less money. Judy Lindenmayer claimed that cost reductions could be as much as 30 or 40 percent.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s04_s03_s01_s01_p03">Norwest, a bank with assets of $71.4 billion and 43,000 staff members in 3,000 locations (in 1997) across the United States, Canada, the Caribbean, Central and South America, and Asia was another company that could provide an example of what attracts corporations to the new concept. Until 1994, Norwest had traditional coverages. Each class of risk had an individual limit of self-insurance, a layer of commercial insurance, and an excess coverage. There were many risks that were not covered by insurance because of lack of availability.</p>

A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">multitrigger contract</a><span class="glossdef">Insurance in which coverage is triggered by the occurrence of more than one event happening within the same time period.</span></span> is insurance in which claims are triggered by the occurrence of more than one event happening within the same time period. The time period is defined in the contract and could be periods such as calendar year, fiscal year, season, or even a day. In a traditional single-trigger policy, a claim is based on the occurrence of any one covered loss, such as an earthquake or a fire. In the multitrigger contract, a claim can be made only if two or more covered incidents occur within that defined contract period. This coverage costs less than individual coverages because the probability of the two (or more) losses happening within the contract time period is lower than the probability of a single loss occurring. In the multitrigger policy, the insurer recognizes this lower probability in the pricing of the product. Thus, it would cost more to buy the earthquake insurance on a stand-alone basis than it would cost to buy earthquake insurance contingent on some other event taking place within that contract time period, such as a shift in foreign exchange or a shift in the cost of a key raw material to the client. Insureds who are concerned only with two very bad losses happening at the same time are those who would be interested in a multitrigger program.</p>

Thus, the insured has promised to pay $60 million over the three-year period, as denoted by increasing increments for each year on the graph. Actual risk transfer—that is, the conventional insurance layer of the finit eprogram—exists between the $60 million that the insured pays in and the $100 million limit.

But what if losses exceed $20 million in the first year? This is the timing risk that the insurer takes—the risk that losses will exceed the insured’s deposit—in which case, the insurer has to pay for them prior to having received the funds from the insured. The graph shows the timing risk in white. It is the difference between the insured’s accumulated payments into the fund and the total amount the insured promises to pay into the fund over the entire time period (in this example, $60 million over a three-year period). The timing layer is similar to a line of credit for the insured. The insured must still pay the insurer for the losses that were paid out in advance, or “loaned” to the insured.</p>

The finite program is outlined with dotted lines. An important part of its program was the inclusion of risks that are traditionally uninsurable. If a loss occurs under the finite program that is also covered by its underlying integrated coverage, the finite program acts as a layer above the integrated limit. Thus, the finite risk protection is pierced when the integrated limit is exhausted—no deductible is incurred under the finite program. If a loss occurs under the finite program and it is not covered by the integrated program, a $100,000 aggregate deductible applies. Such losses are paid if and when aggregate losses under the finite program reach $100,000.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s04_s03_s02_s04_p01">Now, let us show an example of how the experience fund works. <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch23_s04_s03_s02_s04_t01">Table 23.25 "Finite Risk Experience Fund"</a> displays a chart of an experience fund with annual deposits of $20 million for a three-year term. Assume an annual interest rate of 6 percent is credited quarterly to the fund. Also assume that the interest accrues on a tax-free basis, as would be the case if the fund is placed with an offshore insurer where investment income is not subject to taxation. In this example, the insured incurs a $5 million loss in year two. At the end of the term, the insured’s balance is $62,120,260. The funds may be returned to the insured or rolled over to another contract term.</p>

                    <li>Improves the balance sheet—by including risks for which noninsurance reserves had been established, it allows the company to remove these reserves from its balance sheet.</li>
                    <li>Reduces volatility in earnings—instead of paying unpredictable losses out of current earnings, the insured is paying equal payments to the insurer to cover losses; if losses exceed the payments, the insurer pays them and the insured can work out an arrangement to pay them back up to the agreed-on amount that should be paid into the fund.</li>
                    <li>Allows for profit sharing if the loss experience is favorable—the insured earns interest on the payments that it pays to the insurer. In addition, these payments can be structured as tax deductible, whereas reserves on the balance sheet are not deductible until losses are paid.</li>
                    <li>Helps secure insurance for uninsurable risks—because the losses are paid by the insured, a program can be structured without limitations on what types of risk can be included.</li>
                    <li>Accesses new capacity for catastrophic risks—finite programs can be structured so they are layered over a very large retention level, a captive, or other insurance program, such as integrated risk programs or conventional insurance.</li>

                <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s04_s03_s02_s09_p01">Finite risk programs are becoming increasingly popular. But they are not without disadvantages:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s04_s03_s02_s09_l01">
                    <li>Tax and accounting questions—accounting and tax rules say that there must be more than timing and interest rate risk for the insurer in order for the insured’s payments to be tax deductible. The tax code requires that the finite financing arrangement involve real underwriting risk transfer with a reasonable expectation of loss. Transactions that do not meet tax and accounting rules regarding risk transfer will be treated as deposits. The main requirement is that the insurer (or reinsurer) must stand to realize a significant loss from the transaction. Judy Lindenmayer mentions a general rule of thumb that has developed, whereby 10 to 15 percent of the estimated exposure should be transferred to the insurer, and the risk so transferred must have a 10 to 20 percent chance of loss. Actuaries, however, caution against specifying probability thresholds because they do not allow for the differences in frequency and severity of various exposures.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn23_021">“What is ‘Risk Transfer’ in Reinsurance? Comments on Financial Accounting Standard 113,” <em class="emphasis">Contingencies</em>, September/October 1997, 50–53. (Based on a report of the American Academy of Actuaries Committee on Property and Liability Issues.)</span> Evaluation of the risk transfer element is a complex process that requires a complete understanding of the transaction, the details of which are beyond the scope of this course.</li>
                    <li>The premiums should not be construed as a deposit for accounting purposes. The risk transfer element must be verified by outside auditors. It is permissible to base the tax and accounting for the finite program on two different foundations. However, doing so may draw the attention of income tax auditors.</li>
                    <li>Any monies that are returned to the insured at the end of the period constitute taxable income. To avoid a taxable event, the insured can roll the funds over to the next term.</li>
                    <li>Time-consuming and complex to develop—although finite programs can save considerable time once they are in place, they can take up to a year to develop.</li>
                    <li>Frictional costs may be greater than perceived benefits—these costs are estimated to range from 5 to 10 percent. A fee is paid to the insurer, and a federal excise tax applies to premiums paid for programs that are domiciled offshore.</li>
                    <li>Opportunity cost of committed funds—the programs entail large outlays of cash each year of the term. These large outlays, and the fact that they tie up the funds, can overshadow the net cost efficiencies that might have been obtained. Generally, these cash outlays require the involvement of the company’s CFO or other senior manager. Often, the cash outlays form the obstacle to obtaining senior management approval of the program.</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s04_s04_s01_p05">Recently, Dan Button, director of risk management, was appointed director of global risk management, a newly created position to reflect the integration of domestic and international risk management operations. LOCO has a separate operating officer both for its domestic operations and its international operations. Most likely, the separation of operations was the reason that the risk management operations were handled separately as well. Dan and his chief financial officer (CFO), Elaine Matthews, were instrumental in effecting a change. They knew that economies of scale could be realized by consolidating the risk management function on a global basis. Elaine believes in the holistic approach to risk management and involves Dan in the management of all the risks facing the corporation, be they financial, business, or event-type risks that were traditionally under the authority of the risk manager.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s04_s04_s01_p06">LOCO has a rather large amount of reserves on its balance sheet. A considerable portion of the reserves are attributable to the expected E&amp;O losses that were assumed from Kendu Financial Group when it was acquired in 1994. Another big chunk of the reserve amount is attributable to self-insured workers’ compensation losses. LOCO has self-insured its domestic and international workers’ compensation risk since the early 1980s. Even though claims were handled by a third-party administrator, two individuals on Dan’s staff have devoted their full-time work to workers’ compensation issues. Prompted by soft market conditions, Dan decided to insure the risk. He secured Foreign Voluntary Workers’ Compensation coverage for U.S. workers abroad and for foreign nationals, as well as workers’ compensation coverage for the domestic employees. The company has built up fairly significant loss obligations from self-insuring.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s04_s04_s01_p07">LOCO’s business has been changing rapidly over the last several years. It has become more global, more dependent on technology, and more diversified in its operations. This changing risk environment, along with the corporation’s cost-cutting efforts, has compelled Dan to embark on a comprehensive assessment of his risk management department and the corporate risk profile.</p>

                    <li>Alternative risk-financing arrangements are complex arrangements used by large commercial clients that apply to losses above the primary self-insurance retentions or losses above the primary insurance layer.</li>
                    <li>Alternative risk-financing arrangements are tailored to clients’ diverse needs and blend self-insurance, captives, conventional insurance, and excess limits.</li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="para">Integrated risk management identifies, measures, and monitors multiple business, financial, and operational risks to satisfy holistic risk management objectives.</p>

                            <li>An integrated risk program combines lines of insurance coverage into an aggregate, multitrigger contract for a multiyear term for improved efficiency and cost savings.</li>
                            <li>A company’s loss history, predictability of losses, costs of coverage, and risk tolerance influences the determination of coverages to combine in integrated programs.</li>
                            <li>Integrated programs may be structured with one aggregate deductible for the term of the policy or with separate per occurrence deductibles.</li>
                            <li>Savings from integrated risk programs result from premium decreases, customization, comprehensive coverage, more efficient operations, and reduced administrative costs.</li>

                            <li>Finite risk programs allow insureds to share in the underwriting profit and investment income that accrues on premiums, if loss experience is favorable.</li>
                            <li>Finite risk programs are associated with multiyear terms, overall aggregate limits, risk transfer elements, and so forth.</li>
                            <li>The insurer assumes timing risk because losses can exceed funds paid to date by the insured, resulting in liability for the insurer.</li>
                            <li>Finite risk programs can be used in conjunction with integrated risk management.</li>
                            <li>Companies suited for finite programs have high retention levels, unique and/or difficult to insure risks, inadequate availability of traditional coverage, and high liquidity.</li>
                            <li>Finite programs can improve the balance sheet, reduce earnings volatility, secure insurance for previously uninsurable risks, and access new capacity for catastrophic risks.</li>
