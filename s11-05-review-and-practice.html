        <li>How do agents and brokers differ?</li>

        <li>Is the inherently discriminatory nature of underwriting acceptable from a public policy standpoint? Would shifting to a primarily behavior-based approach to risk assessment be feasible?</li>
        <li>What actuarial adjustments are built into the pricing of life insurance premiums?</li>
        <li>Occasionally, Insurer X will reinsure part of Insurer Y’s risks, and Insurer Y will reinsure part of Insurer X’s risks. Doesn’t this seem like merely trading dollars? Explain.</li>
