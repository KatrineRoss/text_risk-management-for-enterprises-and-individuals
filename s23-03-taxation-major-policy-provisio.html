        <h2 class="title editable block">Taxation</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch19_s03_s01_p01">In the United States, we typically pay individual life insurance premiums out of funds on which we previously had paid income taxes. That is, premiums are paid from after-tax income. Therefore, there are no income taxes on the death benefit proceeds.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch19_s03_s01_p02">In general, when premiums are paid from after-tax income, death benefits are not part of the beneficiary’s or anyone else’s gross income.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn19_005">Tax law changes in 1988 made single-premium surrenders and policy loans undesirable because any gain over net premiums becomes taxable immediately. Furthermore, gains are subject to an additional 10 percent tax penalty if the policyowner is less than age fifty-nine and a half. Thus, the tendency of single-premium buyers is to let the policy mature as a death claim. At that time there are no adverse income tax effects.</span> Therefore, whether the death is soon or long after purchasing a $100,000 life insurance policy, the named beneficiary, regardless of relationship, would not incur any federal income taxes on the proceeds, including gains within the cash value portion of the policy. Nontaxable proceeds also include nonbasic benefits such as term riders, accidental death benefits, and paid-up additions. There are some exclusions, but a discussion of the exclusions is beyond the scope of this text. Some life insurance policies include dividends, and these policyholder dividends are excluded from federal income taxation. The federal government reasons that dividends constitute the return of an original overcharge of premiums. The premiums were paid with after-tax dollars, so any portion of those premiums, returned as a dividend, must have already been taxed as well. More will be said about dividends later in this chapter.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch19_s03_s01_p03">Except for single-premium life insurance, the purchase of most life insurance is motivated primarily by a need for death protection. The availability of private life insurance reduces pressures on government to provide welfare to families that experience premature deaths of wage earners. Furthermore, life insurance is owned by a broad cross section of U.S. society. This, along with effective lobbying by life insurers, may help explain the tax treatment of life insurance.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch19_s03_s02_p02">Both sample policies begin with a cover page (similar to any policy’s declarations page) indicating the amounts of coverage and premiums. Because universal life has flexible premiums, the page also includes the monthly deduction statement. The second page in both policies relates to guarantees.

A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">revocable beneficiary</a><span class="glossdef">Life insurance beneficiary that can be changed at will by the policyowner.</span></span> can be changed at will by the policyowner. Most people prefer the revocable provision. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Irrevocable beneficiary</a><span class="glossdef">Life insurance beneficiary that cannot be changed only with the consent of the beneficiary.</span></span> designations, on the other hand, can be changed only with the consent of the beneficiary. For example, a divorced spouse, as part of a property settlement, may be given an irrevocable interest in life insurance on his or her former spouse. The former spouse, as the insured and policyowner, would be required to continue premium payments but could not make a policy loan or other changes that would diminish the rights of the irrevocable beneficiary.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch19_s03_s02_s03_p02">A beneficiary must survive the insured in order to be entitled to the proceeds of the policy. It is customary, therefore, to name one or more beneficiaries who are entitled to the proceeds in the event that the primary (first-named) beneficiary does not survive the insured. These are known as secondary or tertiary <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">contingent beneficiaries</a><span class="glossdef">In life insurance, beneficiaries who are entitled to the proceeds in the event that the primary (first-named) beneficiary does not survive the insured.</span></span>. Such beneficiaries are named and listed in the order of their priority.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch19_s03_s02_s03_p03">If the insured and the primary beneficiary die in the same accident and none of the evidence shows who died first, there is a question as to whether the proceeds shall be paid to the estate of the primary beneficiary or to a contingent beneficiary. In states where the Uniform Simultaneous Death Act has been enacted, the proceeds are distributed as if the insured had survived the beneficiary. Where this act is not in effect, the courts have usually reached the same conclusion. If no contingent beneficiary has been named, the proceeds go to the estate of the policyowner, thus subjecting the proceeds to estate taxes, probate costs, and the claims of creditors. Probate costs are levied by the court that certifies that an estate has been settled properly. Probate costs (but not estate taxes) are avoided when benefits go to a named beneficiary.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch19_s03_s02_s03_p04">A similar problem arises when the primary beneficiary survives the insured by only a short period. In such a case, the proceeds may be depleted by taxes and costs associated with the beneficiary’s estate settlement or because an annuity-type settlement option had been selected. This problem can be solved by adding a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">common disaster provision (or survivorship clause)</a><span class="glossdef">Provides that the beneficiary of a life insurance policy must survive the insured by a specified period of time or must be alive at the time of payment to be entitled to the proceeds.</span></span>, which provides that the beneficiary must survive the insured by a specified period of time (e.g., seven to thirty days) or must be alive at the time of payment to be entitled to the proceeds. If neither of these conditions is fulfilled, the proceeds go to a contingent beneficiary or to the estate of the policyowner if a contingent beneficiary has not been named.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch19_s03_s02_s03_p05">Policyowners should designate the beneficiary clearly. No questions should exist about the identity of the beneficiary at the time of the insured’s death. In designating children as beneficiaries, one must keep in mind that a minor is not competent to receive payment. In the event of the death of the insured prior to the maturity of a beneficiary child, a guardian may have to be appointed to receive the proceeds on behalf of the child. As a general rule, policyowners should avoid naming minors as beneficiaries. Where the objective is a substantial estate to benefit a child or children, the preferable approach would be to name a trust as beneficiary. The child or children (the ones already born and those to be born or join the family unit after a divorce and remarriage) could be the beneficiary(ies) of the trust.</p>

        <div class="section" id="baranoff-ch19_s03_s02_s04">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Payment Methods</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch19_s03_s02_s04_p01">Life insurance is designed to create a sum of money that can be used when the insured dies or the owner surrenders a cash value policy. In the early days of life insurance, the only form in which the death proceeds or cash value of a policy were paid was in a lump sum. Because a lump-sum payment is not desirable in all circumstances, several additional <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">settlement options (or settlement plans</a><span class="glossdef">Allows the policyholder or beneficiary of a life insurance contract to stipulate, from a variety of options, how the death benefit will be provided.</span></span>; also called payment plans) have been developed and are now included in most policies. The owner may select an option in advance or leave the choice to the beneficiary. The owner may also change the option from time to time if the beneficiary designation is revocable. The payment plans have the following methods for death proceeds:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="baranoff-ch19_s03_s02_s04_l01">
                <li>Interest method—the beneficiary leaves the proceeds with the insurer and collects only the interest</li>
                <li>Fixed years method—even distribution of the proceeds over a certain number of years</li>
                <li>Life income method—even distribution of the proceeds over the life of the beneficiary</li>
                <li>Fixed amount method—even distribution of the proceeds until depleted</li>
                <li>Joint life income method—even distribution of the proceeds over the life of the beneficiary, with continued distribution to his or her beneficiary at the same or reduced level</li>
                <li>One-sum method—a lump-sum distribution</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch19_s03_s02_s05_p01">This section also applies to both the whole and the universal life policies. Premiums are payable on the due date on a monthly, quarterly, semiannual, or annual basis. The first premium must be paid in advance, while the insured is in good health and otherwise insurable. Subsequent premiums are due in advance of the period to which they apply. Insurance companies send a notice to the policyowner indicating when the premium is due. The time horizon over which premiums are payable depends on the type of policy (e.g., through age ninety-nine for a straight life policy), and it is stated on the cover page. Note in the sample universal life policy of <a class="xref" href="baranoff-chappD#baranoff-chappD">Chapter 27 "Appendix D"</a> that the premium limitations section allows the insurer to refund any overpayment of premiums. As you know, such possibility may occur because of the flexible premium allowed for universal life policies.</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">Grace Period</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch19_s03_s02_s05_s01_p01">The law requires that the contract contain a provision entitling the policyowner to a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">grace period</a><span class="glossdef">Period of time within which payment of a past-due insurance premium (excluding the first premium) must be accepted by the insurer.</span></span> within which payment of a past-due premium (excluding the first premium) must be accepted by the insurer. The grace period is thirty-one days in the whole life sample in <a class="xref" href="baranoff-chappC#baranoff-chappC">Chapter 26 "Appendix C"</a>. Although the premium is past due during this period, the policy remains in force. If the insured dies during the grace period, the face amount of the policy minus the amount of the premium past due will be paid to the beneficiary. If the premium is not paid during the grace period of a traditional policy, a nonforfeiture option (to be discussed later) becomes effective. The purpose of the grace period is to prevent unintentional lapses. If it were not for this provision, an insured whose premium was paid one day late would have to prove his or her insurability in order to have the policy reinstated.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch19_s03_s02_s05_s01_p02">In variable, universal, and other flexible-premium policies, the grace period is usually sixty days, as seen in the universal life policy in <a class="xref" href="baranoff-chappD#baranoff-chappD">Chapter 27 "Appendix D"</a>. This has meaning only when the cash value is not large enough to cover expense and mortality deductions for the next period. Most insurers notify the policyowner of such a situation. The cash surrender value in the first few policy years may be zero due to surrender charges. In that event, most universal and variable policies also contain a grace period exception clause. This clause states that during a specified period of time (generally the first few policy years, even if the policy has a negative surrender value), as long as at least the stated minimum premium has been paid during the grace period, the policy will continue in force.</p>

If the grace period has expired with a premium still due, the policy is considered to have lapsed.

The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">reinstatement provision</a><span class="glossdef">Provides that unless a life insurance policy has been surrendered for cash, it may be reinstated at any time within five (in some cases, three, ten, or more) years after premium payments were stopped.</span></span> provides that, unless the policy has been surrendered for cash, it may be reinstated at any time within five (in some cases, three, ten, or more) years after premium payments were stopped. Payment of all overdue premiums on the policy and other indebtedness to the insurer, plus interest on these items, is required along with payment of the current premium. Usually, the insured must provide satisfactory evidence of current insurability. This provision is shown in the sample whole life policy in <a class="xref" href="baranoff-chappC#baranoff-chappC">Chapter 26 "Appendix C"</a>, and in the universal life sample in <a class="xref" href="baranoff-chappD#baranoff-chappD">Chapter 27 "Appendix D"</a>.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch19_s03_s02_s05_s03_p02">Evidence of insurability may be as strict in the case of reinstatement as it is for obtaining new life insurance. The insurer may be interested in health, occupation, hobbies, and any other factors that may affect the probability of early death. For recently lapsed policies, most insurers require only a personal health statement from the insured. Universal and variable policies typically provide reinstatement without requiring payment of back premiums, as noted in <a class="xref" href="baranoff-chappD#baranoff-chappD">Chapter 27 "Appendix D"</a>. In this event, the cash value of the reinstated policy equals the amount provided by the premium paid, after deductions for the cost of insurance protection and expenses.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch19_s03_s02_s07_p01">This section illustrates the major differences between the whole life and universal life policies. A whole life policy guarantees that a policyholder who decides to cancel the policy can either take cash for the surrender (cash) value or continue the policy in force as extended term insurance and paid-up insurance. These provisions are also called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">nonforfeiture options</a><span class="glossdef">In whole life insurance, guarantees that a policyholder who decides to cancel the policy can either take cash for the surrender (cash) value or continue the policy in force as extended term insurance and paid-up insurance.</span></span> in other policies.

            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch19_s03_s02_s07_p02">As pointed out earlier, the cash value life plan results in the accumulation of a savings (or cash value element, from the insured’s perspective) that usually increases as each year passes. If the contract is terminated, the policyholder can receive the cash value, or the policy can be converted to <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">extended term insurance</a><span class="glossdef">Nonforfeiture option where the death benefit of a whole life policy continues at its previous level for as long as the cash value supports this amount of term insurance.</span></span> or <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">paid-up insurance</a><span class="glossdef">Nonforfeiture option where death benefits are paid up completely without expiration date, as if a new policy providing a lower death benefit was in place.</span></span>. Under the extended term insurance option, the death benefit continues at its previous level for as long as the cash value supports this amount of term insurance (like a single premium life). Under the paid-up insurance option, it is as if there is a new policy providing a lower lifetime death benefit than the old one did. The death benefits are paid up completely without an expiration date. Both extended term and paid-up options are nonforfeiture options.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch19_s03_s02_s07_p03">With universal, current assumption, and variable universal life policies, the policyowner may discontinue premium payments at any time without lapsing the policy, as long as the surrender value is sufficient to cover the next deduction for the cost of insurance and expenses. In the universal life policy, there is a description of the account value at the end of the first month. It is 95 percent of the initial premium less the monthly deduction. Thereafter, adjustments take the interest rate into account. The following sections are covered in the sample universal life in <a class="xref" href="baranoff-chappD#baranoff-chappD">Chapter 27 "Appendix D"</a>:</p>

Disability may be caused by either accidental injury or sickness; no distinction is made. Typically, for the first two years of benefit payments, the insured is considered totally disabled whenever he or she, because of injury or disease, is unable to perform the duties of the regular occupation. Beyond two years, benefits usually continue only if the insured is unable to perform the duties of any occupation for which he or she qualified by reason of education, training, and experience. A minority of insurers uses this more restrictive definition from the beginning of the waiver period. Most insurers and courts interpret the definition liberally. Most riders define blindness or loss of both hands, both feet, or one hand and one foot as presumptive total disability. Typically, disability longer than six months is considered to be permanent. Circumstances may later contradict this assumption because proof (generally in the form of a physician’s statement) of continued disability is usually required once a year up to age sixty-five.</p>

The amount of each additional purchase is usually equal to or less than the face amount of the original policy. If a $50,000 straight or interest-sensitive life policy with the GIO rider is purchased at age twenty-one, the policyowner can buy an additional $50,000 every three years thereafter to age forty, whether or not the insured is still insurable. By age forty, the total death benefit would equal $350,000. The new insurance is issued at standard rates on the basis of the insured’s attained age when the option is exercised.

The need for funds may significantly exceed benefits provided by medical and disability insurance because of deductibles, coinsurance, caps on benefits, and exclusions, and (perhaps primarily) because of having purchased inadequate coverage. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Accelerated death benefits</a><span class="glossdef">Triggered by either the occurrence of a catastrophic (dread) illness or the diagnosis of a terminal illness, resulting in payment of a portion of a life insurance policy’s face amount prior to death.</span></span> are triggered by either the occurrence of a catastrophic (dread) illness or the diagnosis of a terminal illness, resulting in payment of a portion of a life insurance policy’s face amount prior to death.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch19_s03_s03_s05_p02">The accelerated benefits are also called living benefits, or terminal illness rider. Usually, the terminally ill insured can receive up to 50 percent of the death benefits to improve quality of life before death. Often, the coverage is provided without an additional premium. The benefit can usually be claimed when two doctors agree that the insured has six months or less to live. When the insured desires greater amounts, he or she may use a viatical settlement company to transfer the ownership of the policy to a third party in return for a higher percentage of the death benefits, perhaps 80 percent. A more detailed discussion of viaticals is provided in the box “Do Viatical and Life Settlements Have a Place in Today’s Market?”</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Adjusting Life Insurance for Inflation</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch19_s03_s04_p01">Participating policies, current assumption whole life policies, and universal life policies recognize inflation in a limited manner. Participating contracts can respond to inflation through dividends. Dividends can be used each year to purchase additional amounts of paid-up life insurance, but these small amounts of additional protection seldom keep pace with inflation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch19_s03_s04_p02">Interest-sensitive contracts partly recognize inflation by crediting investment earnings directly to cash values. We say “partly recognize” because cash values in these policies are primarily invested in short-term debt instruments like government securities and in short-term corporate bonds, and the interest rates for these have an expected inflation component at the time they are issued. The expected inflation component is there because, in addition to a basic return on the money being loaned and an increase to reflect financial risks of failure, investors in debt instruments require an incremental return to cover their projections of future inflation rates. Thus, contracts with direct crediting of insurer investment returns to cash values give some recognition to inflation. The recognition is weak, however, for two reasons. First, the protection element of these contracts does not respond quickly, or at all for type A contracts, to inflation.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn19_008">Small recognition in total death benefits exists in type B universal policies because any increases in cash value as a result of higher interest rates are added to a level amount of protection. Dividends may be used to buy additional amounts of insurance, but the relationship to inflation is weak.</span> The protection element is expressed in fixed dollars and, as a storehouse of value and purchasing power, the dollar certainly is not ideal. Second, in a portfolio of primarily debt instruments, all except newly purchased parts reflect inflation expectations formed in the past. These expectations can grossly underestimate current and future rates of inflation.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Buy More Life Insurance</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch19_s03_s04_s01_p01">As long as you are insurable, you can buy more life insurance as your needs increase. What if you become uninsurable? You can protect yourself against that possibility by buying a policy with a guaranteed insurability option; however, this has drawbacks. First, the option is limited to a specified age, such as forty, and you may need more insurance after that age. Second, you must buy the same kind of insurance as the policy you have. Third, the premium will be higher due to your age.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Buy a Cost-of-Living Rider or Policy</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch19_s03_s04_s02_p01">Another alternative is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">inflation rider (or cost-of-living)</a><span class="glossdef">Automatically increases the amount of life insurance as the consumer price index rises.</span></span>, which automatically increases the amount of insurance as the consumer price index (CPI) rises. It provides term insurance in addition to the face amount of your permanent or term policy up to a point, such as age fifty-five for the insured. If, for example, you have a $100,000 whole life policy and the CPI goes up 5 percent this year, $5,000 of one-year term insurance is automatically written for next year at the premium rate for your age. You are billed for it along with the premium notice for your basic policy. Because your premium increases with each increase in coverage, you may conclude that you bear the risk of keeping your coverage up with inflation. Keep in mind that no evidence of insurability is required. You do not have to accept (and pay for) the additional insurance if you don’t want it. If you refuse to exercise the option, however, it is no longer available. In other words, you can’t say, “I’m short of funds this year, but I will exercise the option next year.” <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch19_s03_s04_s02_t01">Table 19.4 "Inflation Rider Option (at 5 Percent Annual Inflation)"</a> illustrates how the inflation rider option would affect your total amount of insurance if you had bought a $100,000 whole life policy in 1995 and the inflation rate was 5 percent every year.</p>

                    <li>The premium on Bill Brown’s traditional whole life policy was due September 1. On September 15, he mailed a check to the insurance company. On September 26, he died. When the insurance company presented the check to the bank for collection, it was returned because there were insufficient funds in Bill’s account. Does the company have to pay the claim presented by Bill’s beneficiary? Why or why not? What provisions might result in payment?</li>
                    <li>If you don’t need life insurance now but realize you may need it sometime in the future, would you be interested in buying a guaranteed insurability option, if it were available, without buying a policy now? Why or why not?</li>
                    <li>Describe the nature of what is purchased by the dividend on a life insurance policy when it is used to buy paid-up additions.</li>
                    <li>What desirable features characterize the policy loan provision of a cash value life insurance policy relative, for example, to borrowing money from a bank? How do policy loans affect death benefits?</li>
                    <li>Can you think of any ways that the terms of an accidental death benefit rider might encourage moral hazard?</li>
                    <li>When the dollar value of your home increases because of inflation, the insurer normally automatically increases the amount of insurance on your dwelling and its contents. Why does your life insurer require evidence of insurability before allowing you to increase the face value of your universal life insurance policy? (Assume no cost-of-living rider or guaranteed insurability rider.) How do you explain this difference between insuring homes and human lives?</li>
