    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_p01">The mandatory coverage for life cycle events risk is Social Security. As noted in <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch16#baranoff-ch16">Chapter 16 "Risks Related to the Job: Workers’ Compensation and Unemployment Compensation"</a>, Social Security is a major social insurance program that was created in 1935 as an outcome of the Great Depression. Originally, this program was a compulsory pension plan known as Old Age Insurance (OAI). Later, survivors’ benefits were added and the program became known as Old Age and Survivors’ Insurance (OASI). When disability benefits were added, it became Old Age, Survivors’, and Disability Insurance (OASDI), and, with the addition of hospital and medical benefits, it became the Old Age, Survivors’, Disability, and Hospital Insurance (OASDHI) program. Social Security is not need-based and depends on a person’s employment history. Its objective is to provide a “floor of protection” or a “reasonable level of living.” <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch18_f01">Figure 18.1 "The Links between Life Cycle Risks and Social Security Benefits"</a> illustrates the idea of a “floor of protection.” Social Security is the foundation on which retirement, survivors’, and disability benefits should be designed. In addition, the program is the foundation for health benefits for the retired population under Medicare Part A (hospitals), Part B (doctors), Part C (managed care medicine), and Part D (the new drug program). The discussion of Social Security is positioned here, in this chapter of the text, to emphasize the importance of Social Security as the foundation for employer-provided benefits, such as group life, disability, and health insurance and retirement programs.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_p02">Most U.S. workers—full-time, part-time, self-employed, and temporary employees—are part of the Social Security program. Every employer and employee is required to contribute in the form of payroll taxes. Social Security provides income in the event of retirement, disability, or death. It also provides medical expense benefits for disabled or retired persons and their specified dependents.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn18_001">All statistics in this chapter are from the Social Security Administration (<a class="link" href="http://www.ssa.gov">http://www.ssa.gov</a>) and the Department of Health and Human Service’s Medicare site (<a class="link" href="http://www.medicare.gov">http://www.medicare.gov</a>).</span> The 2008 Social Security Trustees reported that income to the combined OASDI Trust Funds amounted to $785 billion in 2007. During that year, an estimated 163 million people had earnings covered by Social Security and paid payroll taxes, and the trust funds paid benefits of more than $585 billion to almost 50 million beneficiaries.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn18_002">OASDI Board of Trustees, “Status of the Social Security Program: A Summary of the 2008 Annual Social Security,” <a class="link" href="http://ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/II_highlights.html#76455">http://ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/II_highlights.html#76455</a> (accessed  April 4, 2009).</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_s00_p01">At this point in our study, we get into the foundation of different types of coverage for many of the life cycle, injury, and illness risks. In <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch19#baranoff-ch19">Chapter 19 "Mortality Risk Management: Individual Life Insurance and Group Life Insurance"</a>   to <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch20#baranoff-ch20">Chapter 20 "Employment-Based Risk Management (General)"</a> we will talk about the risk management of all life cycle risks, but in this chapter, we will discuss a basic mandatory package of coverages that is tied to belonging to the work force in the United States. Social Security’s mandatory coverages comprise the first step in building the pyramid of coverages to ensure our complete holistic risk management process. <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch18#baranoff-ch18_f01">Figure 18.1 "The Links between Life Cycle Risks and Social Security Benefits"</a> depicts Social Security as the basic foundation of coverages for life cycle risks, which are part of our holistic risk picture.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_s00_p02">As before, for our holistic risk management we need to look at all sources of coverage available. Understanding each component of the coverages from the various sources is critical to completing the picture and ensuring that we have adequately managed all our risks. Social insurance programs (including workers’ compensation and unemployment compensation discussed in <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch16#baranoff-ch16">Chapter 16 "Risks Related to the Job: Workers’ Compensation and Unemployment Compensation"</a>) play an important role in financial planning and should be considered when assessing the risk of economic loss due to premature death, disability, or retirement. The amount each individual must save for such situations is effectively reduced by the expected benefits from social insurance programs. The Social Security Administration (SSA) sends an annual statement to all workers that includes earnings history and projected future benefits. <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch18_s00_t01">Table 18.1 "Estimated Average Monthly Benefits Payable as of December 2008"</a> provides the estimated average income by beneficiary category as of December 2008.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Definition of Social Insurance</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_s01_s01_p01">Many governmental programs are designed to provide economic security for individuals and families. Both public assistance (also referred to as welfare programs) and social insurance programs are organized and undertaken by the government and have the broad social purpose of reducing want and destitution. However, social insurance is different from public assistance: <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">social insurance</a><span class="glossdef">An insurance program that is compulsory for nearly all Americans with eligibility criteria and benefits specified by law and financed wholly or partially through employment taxes.</span></span> is an insurance program that is compulsory for nearly all Americans, eligibility criteria and benefits are specified by law, and financing is wholly or partially covered by the employer. Unlike public assistance, employers and employees pay into the social insurance system to earn their rights to benefits. Some examples of social insurance programs include workers’ compensation and unemployment compensation, which were covered in <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch16#baranoff-ch16">Chapter 16 "Risks Related to the Job: Workers’ Compensation and Unemployment Compensation"</a>, as well as Social Security.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_s01_s01_p02">Welfare benefits are financed through general revenues that come from both federal and state funds. Benefits received from welfare are not based on contributions made by or on behalf of the recipients. Medicaid is an example of a welfare benefit based solely on need. While public assistance programs have a role in providing economic security, they are not insurance programs. The insurance principles of assessing and pooling risk do not apply to welfare programs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_s01_s01_p03">The types of benefits available from Social Security are apparent from the acronym <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">OASDHI</a><span class="glossdef">Old age (or retirement), survivors, disability, and health insurance (or Medicare) benefits, which include hospital insurance and supplemental medical insurance.</span></span>: old age (or retirement), survivors’, disability, and health (or Medicare) benefits, which include hospital insurance and supplemental medical insurance. The program can be separated into two broad parts. The first part of OASDHI is the old-age, survivors’, and disability (OASD) insurance program known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Social Security</a><span class="glossdef">Social insurance program in the United States guaranteeing old age, survivors, disability (OASD) and health insurance (HI) benefits to eligible citizens who have contributed to the program.</span></span>. The second part of the OASDHI program is Medicare (HI).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_s01_s01_p04">We will begin the discussion about Social Security and Medicare with a description of each social program, its benefits, and its eligibility requirements. Following the general discussion is an explanation of how the programs are financed. We will introduce the two programs separately because there are many differences between Social Security and Medicare. We begin with the eligibility requirements and then discuss the benefits available to eligible employees.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="baranoff-ch18_s01_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Coverage and Eligibility Requirements</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_s01_s02_p01">Today, nearly all employees in private industry, most self-employed persons, and members of the armed forces are covered by Social Security. Coverage is compulsory for more than 90 percent of all workers in the United States, meaning that Social Security taxes must be paid on their wages. The major exceptions are railroad workers, who are covered by the Railroad Retirement Act, and federal government employees, who were covered by other programs before 1984. Prior to 1984, state and local government bodies could elect not to cover certain employees under Social Security. With few exceptions, this option is no longer allowed. Municipal governments that elected out prior to 1984 do have the option to join the Social Security program voluntarily. Ministers are covered automatically unless they request a waiver on religious grounds. Members of religious sects whose beliefs prohibit acceptance of benefits are exempt.</p>
        <div class="section" id="baranoff-ch18_s01_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Eligibility</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_s01_s02_s01_p01">To be eligible to receive benefits, a worker must achieve insured status. There are three levels of insured status: fully insured, currently insured, or disability insured. If the worker’s status is fully insured, most types of Social Security benefits are payable. If the worker does not have enough work tenure to be fully insured, he or she may be currently insured or disability insured, which still allows eligibility for some survivor benefits or disability benefits.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_s01_s02_s01_p02">A person must be in the work force for a minimum number of quarters during which his or her earnings meet minimum criteria. The required earnings per quarter in 2008 was a minimum of $1,050, and in 2009 that amount increased to $1,090. The amount is adjusted every year. An employee can earn a maximum of four credits per year, even if he or she did not work the full four quarters, as long as he or she made enough even in one month (4 × $1,050). A Social Security beneficiary is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">fully insured</a><span class="glossdef">Status achieved by a Social Security beneficiary once forty credits of coverage are earned, or when the beneficiary has a minimum of six credits of coverage and, if greater, at least as many quarters of coverage as there are years elapsing after 1950 (or after age twenty-one, if later)</span></span> once forty credits of coverage are earned, or when the beneficiary has a minimum of six credits of coverage and, if greater, at least as many quarters of coverage as there are years elapsing after 1950 (or after age twenty-one, if later).

            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_s01_s02_s05_p03">We will use the examples provided by the Social Security Administration as a learning tool here. First, we focus on the calculation of the AIME. For each case, we see the columns labeled “nominal earnings.” Indexing brings nominal earnings up to near-current wage levels. For each case, the table shows columns of earnings before and after Indexing. The highest thirty-five years of indexed earnings and the corresponding average monthly amounts of such earnings are used for the benefit computation. The result is the AIME. The indexing requires some special computation. Consequently, there is no easy way to make an estimate of one’s PIA. It is not as simple as finding average wages and consulting a table. The Social Security Administration has computerized wage histories for all workers, and the PIA calculation is made when an application for benefits is processed. The Social Security Administration furnishes annually the calculation of each insured’s PIA. If a person has not received the statement, the Social Security Administration will furnish a record of the historical Social Security earnings and PIA upon request. The Social Security Administration Web site also has an online calculator.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_s01_s02_s05_p04">After the AIME is determined, an individual’s PIA in 2009 would be determined by the formula in <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch18_s01_s02_s05_t02">Table 18.7 "PIA Formula for an Individual in 2009"</a>. The formula shows that Social Security benefit levels, expressed as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">replacement ratios</a><span class="glossdef">Expression of Social Security benefit levels weighted in favor of lower-income workers; calculated as the benefit divided by the AIME.</span></span>, are weighted in favor of lower-income workers.

            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_s01_s02_s06_p01">As described above, the AIME determines the PIA of a retired or disabled worker; the benefit levels for other beneficiaries are a percentage of the PIA. If an individual qualifies as both a worker and as the spouse of a worker, the beneficiary will receive whichever PIA is greater, but not both. Other factors may also affect the benefit amount.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_s01_s02_s06_p02">The maximum family benefit is the maximum monthly amount that can be paid on a worker’s earnings record. The formula for the maximum family benefit, shown in <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch18_s01_s02_s06_t01">Table 18.9 "The PIA Formula for Maximum Family Benefit, 2009"</a>, is based on the worker’s primary insurance amount (PIA). The maximum PIA for the family is computed based on the bend points shown in <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch18_s01_s02_s06_t01">Table 18.9 "The PIA Formula for Maximum Family Benefit, 2009"</a>. When the family reaches its maximum family benefit, the worker’s benefit is not reduced but the benefits of the survivors or dependents are reduced proportionately. There is also a minimum PIA for very-low-wage workers who have been covered by Social Security for at least ten years. This attempts to address the broad social purpose of Social Security: reducing want and destitution by providing an adequate income to insured workers.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn18_007">To be eligible for “special minimum” benefits, a worker must earn at least a certain portion (25 percent in years 1990 and before, and 15 percent in years following 1990) of the “old law” contribution and benefit base.</span></p>

In addition, workers receiving Social Security disability income may have Social Security benefits reduced to offset other disability benefits received from governmental programs, such as workers’ compensation, to reduce the moral hazard of malingering. Legislation enacted in 1973 provides for automatic cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs). The theory is to prevent inflation from eroding the value of Social Security and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits.

            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_s01_s03_s01_p01">Social Security benefits are financed through payroll taxes paid by employers and employees and by a special tax on earnings paid by the self-employed. The tax rate for employers and employees is 6.2 percent for OASDI, up to a maximum amount of earnings called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">wage base level</a><span class="glossdef">Specifies the maximum amount of earnings on which Social Security taxation applies.</span></span>, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch18_s01_s03_s01_t01">Table 18.12 "OASDI Annual Wage Base for Tax Purposes"</a>, and 1.45 percent for HI (Medicare Part A) on all earnings. The tax rates scheduled under current law are shown in <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch18_s01_s03_s01_t02">Table 18.13 "Tax Rates Paid on Wages and Earnings"</a>. Those who elect Medicare Part B coverage pay monthly premiums via deductions from their Social Security benefits checks.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_s01_s03_s01_p02">Social Security taxes, sometimes called FICA taxes (after the Federal Insurance Contributions Act of 1939), are automatically withheld on wages up to a set amount and are adjusted annually for inflation. Any wages earned over this wage base are not taxed for Social Security, although Medicare Part A taxes are still deducted.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_s01_s03_s01_p03">The tax rates are intended to remain constant (the last hike was in 1990), but the taxable wage base is adjusted annually to reflect increases in average wages. As you can see in <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch18_s01_s03_s01_t01">Table 18.12 "OASDI Annual Wage Base for Tax Purposes"</a>, the 2008 annual wage base was $102,000, and it is $106,800 in 2009, meaning employers, employees, and the self-employed paid OASDI taxes on individual wages up to the wage base. If wages increase 5 percent the following year, the tax rates would remain the same but the taxable wage base would increase by 5 percent, thus increasing total Social Security tax revenue (all else being equal). Wages beyond the threshold are not subject to the OASDI tax, but they are subject to the Medicare Part A tax.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_s01_s03_s01_p04">Social Security benefits are subject to income taxes. More specifically, taxes are payable on 50 percent of the Social Security benefit by single persons whose taxable incomes (including 50 percent of Social Security benefits and any interest on tax-exempt bonds) are between $25,000 and $34,000 (between $32,000 and $44,000 for married couples filing joint returns). If income exceeds $34,000 for single persons (or $44,000 for married couples filing jointly), up to 85 percent of the Social Security benefit received at retirement as income is taxable.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_s01_s03_s02_p01">The funds collected from payroll taxes are allocated among three trust funds. One trust fund is for retirement and survivors’ benefits; the second is for disability insurance; and the third is for hospital insurance, or Medicare Part A. Medicare Parts B and D, supplementary medical benefits, are financed by monthly premiums from persons enrolled in the program, along with amounts appropriated from the general revenue of the federal government. These funds are deposited in a fourth trust fund, the supplementary medical insurance trust fund.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_s01_s04_p01">The Social Security program is administered by the Social Security Administration, an agency of the United States Department of Health and Human Services. Local service is provided by offices located in the principal cities and towns of the fifty states and Puerto Rico. Applications for Social Security numbers and the various benefits as well as enrollment for the medical insurance plan (discussed next) are processed by the district office. The administration is set up to help beneficiaries in catastrophic times, as was evident following Hurricane Katrina. Because so many people were displaced, the Social Security Administration created emergency offices and stations to continue immediate payments to the evacuees.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn18_011">Social Security Administration, “Social Security Responds to Hurricane Katrina, Agency Issues More Than 30,000 Emergency Checks to Date,” Social Security Press Release, September 9, 2005, Accessed April 5, 2009, <a class="link" href="http://www.ssa.gov/pressoffice/pr/katrina-pr.html">http://www.ssa.gov/pressoffice/pr/katrina-pr.html</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_s01_s04_p02">Disability determination—the decision whether or not an applicant for disability benefits is disabled as defined in the law—is made by a state agency (usually the vocational rehabilitation agency) under agreements between the state and the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. Qualification for hospital and medical benefits is determined by the district office, but claims for such benefits are processed through private insurer intermediaries under contract with the Social Security Administration.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_s01_s04_p03">The first decision concerning a person’s qualification for benefits under the various parts of the program is made at the local level. Simple, effective procedures exist for appeal by any applicant for whom the decision is unsatisfactory. There is no charge for such appeals, and the agency strives to provide courteous assistance to the claimant.</p>

            <p class="para" id="baranoff-ch18_s01_s04_p04">In this section you studied the features of Social Security, a compulsory social insurance program paying old age, survivors’, and disability (OASD) benefits:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="baranoff-ch18_s01_s04_l01">
                <li>A person must be in the work force a minimum number of quarters, during which earnings must meet minimum amounts to be eligible for Social Security benefits.</li>
                <li>The level of benefit depends on a worker’s status as fully insured, currently insured, or disability insured.</li>
                <li>Fully insured workers, their aged spouses, and dependent children are eligible to receive retirement (old-age) benefits beginning at the worker’s retirement age (which depends on birth year) and disability benefits.</li>
                <li>Benefits are reduced in the case of early retirement and increased in the case of late retirement.</li>
                <li>A fully insured worker under age sixty-five with a medical condition that prevents substantial gainful work can receive <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">disability benefits</a><span class="glossdef">Available to a fully insured worker (and eligible dependents) in Social Security who has a medically determinable physical or mental condition preventing any gainful work after a waiting period of five full months if he or she is under age sixty-five and has been disabled for twelve months, is expected to be disabled for at least twelve months, or has a disability that is expected to result in death.</span></span> after a waiting period if he or she has been disabled for twelve months, is expected to be disabled at least twelve months, or has a disability expected to result in death.</li>
                <li>Survivors (aged spouses, disabled spouses, and dependents) of deceased fully, currently, or disability insured workers are also eligible to receive old-age survivors’ or disability benefits.</li>
                <li>The primary insurance amount (PIA), computed from average indexed monthly earnings (AIME) up to the Social Security wage base, is used to determine the amount of monthly benefits.</li>
                <li>The PIA formula is weighted to help lower-income workers at three different bend points—the sum of these amounts equals the monthly benefit, with COLAs made annually.</li>
                <li>Benefits are subject to (1) a monthly maximum that can be paid on a worker’s earnings record, at which survivors’ benefits are reduced proportionately, and (2) an earnings test, whereby benefits are reduced for retirees whose earned income exceeds the retirement earnings exempt amount.</li>
                <li>Social Security benefits are financed through payroll taxes on employers and employees at 6.2 percent (OASDI) and 1.45 percent (HI) up to the wage base level (adjusted annually).</li>
                <li>Benefits are paid through the Social Security trust fund, which is made up of employment tax revenues, benefit income tax revenues, interest on investments, and other income.</li>
                <li>The Social Security program is a pay-as-you-go system administered by the Social Security Administration (part of the Department of Health and Human Services), with offices to handle applications in each state.</li>

The company provides all the social insurance programs required by law and most standard employee benefits plans. Last year, Baylor Crane suffered a high severity of losses when the top five floors of a high rise collapsed in Virginia Beach during strong winds. Luckily, most workers escaped injuries, except six workers who stayed to secure the building. Three of them sustained severe injuries and Johnny Kendle, the sixty-four-year-old supervisor, was killed. The injured workers are back at work except for Tom Leroy, who is still on disability.

Medicare Part C enrollees are limited to a network of benefit providers, a feature similar to managed care health plans (discussed in <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch22#baranoff-ch22">Chapter 22 "Employment and Individual Health Risk Management"</a>). Going outside the network causes some expenses to be passed on to participants.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_s02_s02_p04">Medicare Advantage plans are offered to eligible persons through managed care, preferred provider organization (PPO), private fee-for-service, and specialty arrangements. You will learn about all of these concepts in <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch22#baranoff-ch22">Chapter 22 "Employment and Individual Health Risk Management"</a>. Membership cards are issued to Medicare Part C participants by plan providers. Because the range of covered services varies among Medicare Advantage providers, premiums for Medicare Part C benefits are not fixed by the Social Security Administration. Participants typically pay an amount equal to Medicare Part B premiums plus an additional charge for the added benefits of Medicare Part C. Medicare Advantage providers who choose to cover less for certain benefits than would be paid by Medicare Parts A and B typically lower out-of-pocket costs for plan participants so that they do not pay more for proportionately less coverage. Providers are compensated by the government. Additionally, benefit formulas that overpay providers of Medicare Advantage plans relative to traditional Medicare benefits result in a net extra benefit value for participants.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_s02_s02_p05"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Medicare Part D</a><span class="glossdef">Benefit of Social Security created through the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 that provides assistance for costs relating to prescription medications.</span></span> is the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (P.L. 108–173), enacted December 8, 2003. It requires the Social Security Administration to undertake a number of additional Medicare-related responsibilities. Under Medicare Part D, the Social Security Administration and the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) work together to provide persons with limited income and resources with extra help paying for their prescription drugs. The start date of this program was January 1, 2006. Insurance companies and other private companies work with Medicare to provide a choice of plans that cover both brand-name and generic drugs. To enroll, a beneficiary must have Medicare Part A and/or Medicare Part B. The combination of Part C Medicare Advantage plans with Part D prescription drug benefits are known as Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug (MAPD) plans.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_s02_s02_p06">Medicare D premiums are not set in stone. For example, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services released the following in September 2005: “The average Part D monthly premium will be $32, about 14 percent lower than had been projected, with plans in virtually all areas of the country available for a premium of under $20 or even less. The drug benefit will provide help with prescription drug costs that for many beneficiaries will exceed the premium cost.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn18_012">“Medicare Premiums and Deductibles for 2006,” CMS Office of Public Affairs, September 16, 2005, <a class="link" href="http://www.cms.hhs.gov/apps/media/press/release.asp?Counter=1557">http://www.cms.hhs.gov/apps/media/press/release.asp?Counter=1557</a>, Accessed April 5, 2009.</span></p>

For those with limited income and resources, there is a way to qualify for extra help that will cover between 85 and almost 100 percent of drug costs. Most people who are eligible for this extra help pay no premiums, no deductibles, and no more than $5 for each prescription. The amount of extra help depends on income and resources. In the beginning of 2006, the help promised was not in place, so the states helped those in need.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Issues in Social Security</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_s03_s01_p01">During the 2000 presidential election campaign, Social Security financing was the most heated issue, with the debate focusing on privatization and moving away from the pay-as-you-go system. When the stock market was booming and everyone believed they could do better by investing their own funds, the idea of moving away from the current system became very appealing; however, their tune changed after the large decline in the stock market. The immediate big issue in early 2006 was how to help those who could not pay the deductibles and coinsurance for the new drug program. The major funding problems are still at issue.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_s03_s01_p02">Social Security and Medicare were originally designed to operate with advance funding, but for many years they have operated on an unfunded, pay-as-you-go basis. As a result, this generation of workers is paying for the benefits of current beneficiaries. Social Security taxes have increased much faster than the general level of prices and even faster than the cost of health care during the past two decades.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_s03_s01_p03">As described in the box “Does Privatization Provide a More Equitable Solution?” and depicted in <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch18_s03_s01_f01">Figure 18.2 "Number of Workers per OASDI Beneficiary"</a>, the number of retired workers has increased faster than the number of those working. In 1945, there were forty-two workers per retiree. Currently, this has decreased to approximately three workers per retiree and is expected to decline to two by 2020. The Social Security funding burden is being borne by a shrinking sector of society because birth rates have declined and longevity has increased. This trend will continue as the baby boomers move out of the work force and into retirement. Retired workers are concerned about the certainty of their benefits and future required tax rates. The current generation of taxpayers has serious doubts about the ability of the Social Security system to deliver benefits at current inflation-adjusted levels.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_s03_s01_p04">Such doubts are understandable, considering recent problems of the OASI program, which is by far the largest part of the system. Each year, the trustees of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds report on the funds’ status and their projected condition over the next seventy-five years. The 2008 Annual Reports continue to show that both Social Security and Medicare need serious reform.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn18_013">Social Security and Medicare Board of Trustees’ Summary of the 2008 Annual Reports on the status of the Social Security and Medicare Programs. The goal of the public trustees is to approach the current state of Social Security and Medicare in a nonpartisan way. They aim to ensure the integrity of the reports, both in methods of preparation and in the credibility of the information they contain. Realizing that numerous assumptions must be made to predict the future condition of the funds, the trustees prepare these reports because they believe the reports paint the most reliable picture available today. This summary is available online at <a class="link" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TRSUM/trsummary.html">http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TRSUM/trsummary.html</a>.</span> Both programs face a long-term financing gap. Closing the gap between monies going into the Social Security and Medicare funds and monies coming out of the funds will be a challenge. It will force the government to come up with innovative solutions to fixing the long-term deficits.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_s03_s01_p06">Whether the objective of the Social Security program should be to provide a “floor of protection” or a “reasonable level of living” remains debatable. Reform will require agreement, however, by politicians and the public on not only what benefits citizens are entitled to, but what benefits taxpayers are willing to fund. See the box “The Future of Social Security,” for a discussion of this topic.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Global Trends in Social Security Systems</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_s03_s02_p01">In many countries, financing the government social security system has become increasingly difficult for several reasons. Benefit levels have increased in many nations, to the point where the tax rates necessary to support benefits are at an all-time high. For example, free or very-low-cost medical care may be available to everyone, disability benefits may require little proof of inability to work, and generous disability payments may result in the moral hazard of malingering. Demographic trends in other industrialized nations mirror those in the United States: the population is aging, so fewer workers finance the pay-as-you-go system for retirees. The declining birth rate suggests that this trend is unlikely to be reversed. In addition, other governments also face the problem of growing budget deficits. Governments in some developing countries may be perceived as unable to administer the social security system fairly and efficiently.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_s03_s02_p02">Experts anticipate a shift from public sector social insurance plans to private sector plans, especially for retirement benefits. Private sector organizations, particularly insurance companies, have successfully managed retirement savings and income for decades and are in a position to improve management and funding practices. Several countries have already begun to privatize the social security system, namely, Chile, Peru, Mexico, Italy, and Japan. In Chile (beginning in 1981) and Peru (in 1993), for example, workers are required to contribute to their own retirement fund, and contributions are invested by a private pension fund manager selected by the worker. In both these countries, the prefunded privatized system appears to be working well. Some countries also are moving toward privatized medical care systems.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_s03_s02_p03">The trend toward privatization is worldwide, including both industrialized and developing countries. The potential for market expansion for insurers and other financial institutions is tremendous.</p>

            <span class="blockquote" id="baranoff-ch18_s03_s02_bl01">
                <p class="para" id="baranoff-ch18_s03_s02_p04">The threat to the stability of Social Security has been apparent for decades. For years, political leaders have agreed that something must be done…. We can postpone action no longer. Social Security is a challenge now; if we fail to act, it will become a crisis. We must save Social Security and we now have the opportunity to do so.</p>
            </span>
            <p class="para" id="baranoff-ch18_s03_s02_p05">With these words, on May 2, 2001, President George W. Bush established the Presidential Commission to Strengthen Social Security.</p>
            <p class="para" id="baranoff-ch18_s03_s02_p06">The crisis President Bush was referring to is the declining numbers of new workers paying into the Social Security system. Fewer births and longer life expectancies are causes. In 1940, when the first benefits were paid, there were more than forty workers paying for each retiree receiving benefits. In 1960, there were five workers for each retiree. Today, there are 3.4 workers paying for each beneficiary. With the baby boom generation set to retire over the next few decades, that number is expected to fall even further. The Presidential Commission’s report estimates that the ratio will be 2.2:1 in 2025 and just 2:1 by 2050.</p>
            <p class="para" id="baranoff-ch18_s03_s02_p07">These demographic changes mean that the burden of paying for Social Security will fall ever more heavily on the younger generation of workers. When polled, 41 percent of young people (ages eighteen to thirty-four) said that they do not expect to receive Social Security benefits at today’s level when they retire, while 31 percent expected to receive no benefits at all.</p>
            <p class="para" id="baranoff-ch18_s03_s02_p08">Certainly, current benefit levels cannot be maintained without raising Social Security withholding taxes or extending the normal retirement age. But is it fair to tax younger workers more heavily to pay for their parents’ retirement? Will there even be any money left for their own retirement? One solution that has been proposed is individual investment accounts that would allow individuals to invest a percentage of their Social Security savings themselves. Proponents of privatization argue that it would allow greater returns than the traditional Social Security system.</p>
            <p class="para" id="baranoff-ch18_s03_s02_p09">In the heady days of soaring stock prices and budget surpluses, just before President Bush created the commission, privatization was a popular solution. Workers, it was argued, could invest their Social Security funds in the stock market and see great returns. Low-wage workers would become shareholders in the U.S. economy and be able to accumulate wealth. Money would flow into the economy.</p>
            <p class="para" id="baranoff-ch18_s03_s02_p10">With the economic recession that began in 2008, privatization has lost momentum. But even when the plan was first proposed, it faced opposition on a number of grounds. The pay-as-you-go system is a guaranteed benefit. With many retirees depending on Social Security as their main source of income, this guarantee is crucial. But what happens if an individual invested unwisely? Proponents of a private system argue that an education campaign, along with requirements for diversification and safeguards against high-risk investments, should prevent such losses.</p>
            <p class="para" id="baranoff-ch18_s03_s02_p11">Another argument against privatization is the distortion it could cause in the stock market. With a large number of funds flowing into mutual funds from Social Security investors, prices might be driven up artificially. Government-approved mutual funds would receive a huge windfall in fees.</p>
            <p class="para" id="baranoff-ch18_s03_s02_p12">Most young people, who politicians have argued would benefit the most from privatization, do not support changing the Social Security system but would rather see the existing system strengthened. A majority polled say that “making sure that people receive a decent, guaranteed monthly retirement benefit” is a higher priority than “making sure that people receive a better rate of return.”</p>
            <p class="simpara">Questions for Discussion</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist" id="baranoff-ch18_s03_s02_l01">
                <li>Who should be responsible for the welfare of the retired population? The current workers or the retirees (who should save for it)?</li>
                <li>Is it appropriate for the government to mandate forced savings in private accounts in lieu of the pay-as-you-go Social Security system? Would this action change the nature of the requirements from taxes to private saving?</li>
                <li>If part of the individual accounts would be administered by the government, is it ethical for the government to essentially become a major shareholder in private companies?</li>

            <h3 class="title">The Future of Social Security</h3>
            <p class="para" id="baranoff-ch18_s03_s02_p13">A quick glance at <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch18_s03_s01_f02">Figure 18.3 "Long-Range OASI and DI Annual Income Rates and Cost Rates (as a Percentage of Taxable Payroll), Trustees Report 2008"</a> shows that the costs of Social Security are rising faster than the payments into the system. In the 2008 Annual Report to Congress, the Trustees announced the following:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="baranoff-ch18_s03_s02_l02">
                <li>The projected point at which tax revenues will fall below program costs comes in 2011</li>
                <li>The projected point at which the trust funds will be exhausted comes in 2041</li>
                <li>The projected actuarial deficit over the seventy-five-year, long-range period is 3.54 percent of taxable payroll</li>
                <li>Over the seventy-five-year period, the trust funds require additional revenue, equivalent to $4.3 trillion in today’s dollars to pay all scheduled benefits.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para" id="baranoff-ch18_s03_s02_p14"><a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch18_s03_s01_f02">Figure 18.3 "Long-Range OASI and DI Annual Income Rates and Cost Rates (as a Percentage of Taxable Payroll), Trustees Report 2008"</a> and <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch18_s03_s01_f03">Figure 18.4 "OASDI and HI Income Shortfall to Pay Scheduled Benefits, and the 75 Percent General Fund Revenue Contribution to SMI (Percentage of GDP), Trustees Report 2008"</a> are from the 2008 OASDI Trustees Report on the current and projected financial condition of all the Social Security programs. (The six trustees of the board are the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Commissioner of Social Security, and two members appointed by the president.) The programs are financed through four separate trust funds: the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) Trust Fund, Disability Insurance (DI), and two for Medicare.</p>
            <p class="para" id="baranoff-ch18_s03_s02_p15">To project future effects on the bottom line, the trustees review available evidence and gather expert opinion about all the factors that affect income and expenditures: demographic (birth rate, mortality, immigration); economic (unemployment rates, inflation); and program-specific (retirement patterns, disability incidence). The trustees make both short-range (ten-year) and long-range (seventy-five-year) predictions.</p>
            <p class="para" id="baranoff-ch18_s03_s02_p16">Traditional solutions to the looming Social Security and Medicare budget crisis have focused on increasing these taxes and cutting benefits. President G. W. Bush, in his State of the Union address on January 31, 2006, called for a bipartisan committee to find a solution to the impending major shortfall as the baby boom generation begins retirement. President Bush and many members of Congress believed the answer was privatization—allowing workers to invest some or all of their own (private) Social Security funds in the stock market, which historically yields greater returns over long investment periods than Treasury securities do. Beliefs in an ownership society and personal responsibility lie behind this objective. After Chile’s successful move to privatization in 1981, almost every South American country has followed suit, with positive results. Countries from Singapore to Hungary have also converted successfully. With the economic recession of 2008 and the arrival of a new administration, focus has shifted from Social Security as a major political issue. But there are many arguments on both sides, and it remains to be seen how the Social Security system will be preserved.</p>

        <li>How is Social Security financed?</li>

            <p class="para">C. J. Abbott worked hard all his life and built up a successful business. His daily routine involves helping with management decisions in the business, even though the majority of it is now owned and managed by his sons. He continues to draw a salary from the company sufficient to cover his expenses each month. C. J. is fully insured under Social Security and applied for benefits at age sixty-two. However, he does not presently receive, nor has he ever received, Social Security benefits. He celebrated his sixty-fourth birthday last May.</p>

        <li>Your father-in-law was employed by a state agency for forty years before his retirement last year. He was not covered by Social Security on his state job. During the last five years of his career with the state government, however, you employed him on a part-time basis to do some surveying work on a housing development for which you had an engineering contract. You withheld Social Security tax from his wages and turned his share, plus yours as his employer, over to the government.</li>
        <li>
            <p class="para">When your father-in-law retired, he applied for Social Security retirement benefits. Several months later, he was notified that he was not entitled to benefits because the work he did for you was in the family and not bona fide employment. The implication in the notice he received was that the job you gave him was designed to qualify him for Social Security benefits rather than to provide him with real employment.</p>
