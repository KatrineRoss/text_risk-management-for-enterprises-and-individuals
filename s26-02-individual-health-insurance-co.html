        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch22_s02_s01_p02">As you can see, one of the offers includes an HSA. Despite the high deductible of Saver 80, the plan is not HSA-compatible. While the above figures provide merely an overview, eHealthInsurance allows detailed comparisons among all available plans, and the reader is invited to take advantage of this feature. It is important to compare the policies based on the benefit package; cost sharing (such as copays, coinsurance, and deductibles); and other factors, including gender. Most of all, the comparison should include what the student assumes his or her needs may be.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch22_s02_s01_p03">In Case 2 of <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch23#baranoff-ch23">Chapter 23 "Cases in Holistic Risk Management"</a>, the most noticeable difference between the individual plan and the group plan regards maternity benefits. Maternity benefits are available as a rider, or optional coverage, in the individual policy, but they cannot be optional in group insurance because of the Civil Rights Act described in <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch20#baranoff-ch20">Chapter 20 "Employment-Based Risk Management (General)"</a>. The act requires employers to treat pregnancies as any other medical condition.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch22_s02_s02_p01">Some health policies reimburse only for specific illnesses (such as cancer), pay only a per diem amount for medical expenses, or are otherwise very limited in coverage. The consumer needs to read individual policies carefully. These policies are not for reimbursement of medical services.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch22_s02_s02_p02">“Critical illness insurance is one of those product areas that is almost guaranteed to spark a spirited debate when insurance folks get together and talk about sales,” said <em class="emphasis">National Underwriter</em> reporter Linda Koco in “Critical Illness Insurance: Real or Gimmick?”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn22_016">Linda Koco, “Critical Illness Insurance: Real or Gimmick?” <em class="emphasis">National Underwriter</em>, Life &amp; Health/Financial Services Edition, January 1, 2002.</span> “Some producers call it a brand-new kind of policy—the fourth leg of the living benefits stool (life, health, and disability insurance being the other three). But others aren’t so kind. They sniff at it and walk away baffled about why it’s even here. Some dismiss it outright, as a gimmick or some sort of warmed-over cancer insurance.” A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">cancer or critical illness policy</a><span class="glossdef">Pays for the extra expenses incurred during the period of medical treatment for a covered illness; used to supplement medical coverage.</span></span> is designed to pay for the extra expenses incurred during the period of medical treatment. It does not pay the doctors or any of the medical bills that are paid by health insurance. It is not a disability income policy for lost time at work (discussed later in this chapter) or accelerated benefits available in a life insurance policy. It is meant to cover the travel expenses associated with the illness, such as parents staying at a hotel next to the hospital of the child if the hospital is far away from home. It will also pay for adaptive equipment expenses such as reconfiguration of a bathroom. One of the attributes that makes this coverage interesting to buyers is the critical illness policy’s lump-sum payment upon diagnosis of a dread or critical illness. Insureds believe that the coverage helps them cope with the health crisis and recovery.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn22_017">Patrick D. Lusk, “Critical Illness Insurance Ideal for Worksite,” <em class="emphasis">National Underwriter</em>, Life &amp; Health/Financial Services Edition, August 31, 1998.</span> But, like all coverages, a detailed need analysis should accompany the decision to buy such coverage.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch22_s02_s02_p03">Critical illness policies were introduced in the United States in the mid-1990s. Numerous insurance companies offer the product. One that you may be familiar with is AFLAC. The products are vastly different across the states because of varying regulations, but typically the policy pays a lump sum when the insured is diagnosed with a qualified illness. Individual contracts usually require insurability evidence. Several important questions should be asked when evaluating a critical illness policy, including how many illnesses it covers and whether the definitions of illness are precise. The American Cancer Society regards these policies as supplementing medical coverage. The coinsurance and deductibles of a major medical policy are a major source of financial burden to families inflicted with a critical illness because such policies have no limits on out-of-pocket expenses.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn22_018">IEEE Financial Advantage Program, insurance articles of interest at <a class="link" href="http://www.ieeeinsurance.com">http://www.ieeeinsurance.com</a> (accessed  April 22, 2009).</span> The supplemental expense policies are available to ease this hardship. They are not to replace the health insurance but rather to help with catastrophic out-of-pocket costs. The policy also provides an initial sum of money to help cope with a critical illness. The reader is advised not to use such a policy in lieu of health insurance because a critical illness policy does not provide medical insurance, and the debate about the real need for such policies has never subsided.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch22_s02_s03_s01_p02">Group dental insurance is available from insurance companies (under fee-for-service plans); dental service plans; Blue Cross and Blue Shield; and managed-care dental plans such as dental HMOs, dental PPOs, and dental POSs. The rules under these plans are similar to that of medical expense plans. Most of the dental plans cover all types of treatment, with a schedule of maximum benefits for each procedure, such as no more than $2,000 for orthodontic treatment. Benefits are subject to coinsurance and deductibles, and the limitation may be for a calendar year maximum ($500 to $2,000) or a lifetime maximum ($1,000 to $5,000), or both. Teeth cleaning may be paid for once every six months. COBRA rules apply to dental plans.

            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch22_s02_s03_s02_p02">Dental insurance policies encourage better dental health by not applying a deductible or coinsurance to charges for checkups and cleaning. By having first-dollar coverage, insureds are more likely to seek routine diagnostic care, which enables early detection of problems and may reduce total expenditures. Dental policies not only cover routine care but also protect insureds against more expensive procedures such as restorative services. For restorative and orthodontic services, insureds usually pay a deductible or coinsurance amount. A fee schedule limits the amount paid per procedure, so the insured may also pay out-of-pocket for the cost of services above the scheduled amount. Policy maximums are specified on an annual and lifetime basis, such as $2,000 per year and $50,000 during a lifetime.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch22_s02_s03_s02_p03">Many dentists consult with the insured in advance of the procedure to determine what will be paid by insurance. The dentist lists what needs to be done and then the dentist or the insured checks with the insurer to determine coverage. Most policies exclude coverage for purely cosmetic purposes, losses caused by war, and occupational injuries or sickness.</p>
