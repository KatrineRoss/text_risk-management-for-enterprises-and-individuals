        <h2 class="title editable block">Definition of Social Insurance</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_s01_s01_p01">Many governmental programs are designed to provide economic security for individuals and families. Both public assistance (also referred to as welfare programs) and social insurance programs are organized and undertaken by the government and have the broad social purpose of reducing want and destitution. However, social insurance is different from public assistance: <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">social insurance</a><span class="glossdef">An insurance program that is compulsory for nearly all Americans with eligibility criteria and benefits specified by law and financed wholly or partially through employment taxes.</span></span> is an insurance program that is compulsory for nearly all Americans, eligibility criteria and benefits are specified by law, and financing is wholly or partially covered by the employer. Unlike public assistance, employers and employees pay into the social insurance system to earn their rights to benefits. Some examples of social insurance programs include workers’ compensation and unemployment compensation, which were covered in <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch16#baranoff-ch16">Chapter 16 "Risks Related to the Job: Workers’ Compensation and Unemployment Compensation"</a>, as well as Social Security.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_s01_s01_p02">Welfare benefits are financed through general revenues that come from both federal and state funds. Benefits received from welfare are not based on contributions made by or on behalf of the recipients. Medicaid is an example of a welfare benefit based solely on need. While public assistance programs have a role in providing economic security, they are not insurance programs. The insurance principles of assessing and pooling risk do not apply to welfare programs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_s01_s01_p03">The types of benefits available from Social Security are apparent from the acronym <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">OASDHI</a><span class="glossdef">Old age (or retirement), survivors, disability, and health insurance (or Medicare) benefits, which include hospital insurance and supplemental medical insurance.</span></span>: old age (or retirement), survivors’, disability, and health (or Medicare) benefits, which include hospital insurance and supplemental medical insurance. The program can be separated into two broad parts. The first part of OASDHI is the old-age, survivors’, and disability (OASD) insurance program known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Social Security</a><span class="glossdef">Social insurance program in the United States guaranteeing old age, survivors, disability (OASD) and health insurance (HI) benefits to eligible citizens who have contributed to the program.</span></span>. The second part of the OASDHI program is Medicare (HI).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_s01_s01_p04">We will begin the discussion about Social Security and Medicare with a description of each social program, its benefits, and its eligibility requirements. Following the general discussion is an explanation of how the programs are financed. We will introduce the two programs separately because there are many differences between Social Security and Medicare. We begin with the eligibility requirements and then discuss the benefits available to eligible employees.</p>

    <div class="section" id="baranoff-ch18_s01_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Coverage and Eligibility Requirements</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_s01_s02_p01">Today, nearly all employees in private industry, most self-employed persons, and members of the armed forces are covered by Social Security. Coverage is compulsory for more than 90 percent of all workers in the United States, meaning that Social Security taxes must be paid on their wages. The major exceptions are railroad workers, who are covered by the Railroad Retirement Act, and federal government employees, who were covered by other programs before 1984. Prior to 1984, state and local government bodies could elect not to cover certain employees under Social Security. With few exceptions, this option is no longer allowed. Municipal governments that elected out prior to 1984 do have the option to join the Social Security program voluntarily. Ministers are covered automatically unless they request a waiver on religious grounds. Members of religious sects whose beliefs prohibit acceptance of benefits are exempt.</p>
        <div class="section" id="baranoff-ch18_s01_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Eligibility</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_s01_s02_s01_p01">To be eligible to receive benefits, a worker must achieve insured status. There are three levels of insured status: fully insured, currently insured, or disability insured. If the worker’s status is fully insured, most types of Social Security benefits are payable. If the worker does not have enough work tenure to be fully insured, he or she may be currently insured or disability insured, which still allows eligibility for some survivor benefits or disability benefits.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_s01_s02_s01_p02">A person must be in the work force for a minimum number of quarters during which his or her earnings meet minimum criteria. The required earnings per quarter in 2008 was a minimum of $1,050, and in 2009 that amount increased to $1,090. The amount is adjusted every year. An employee can earn a maximum of four credits per year, even if he or she did not work the full four quarters, as long as he or she made enough even in one month (4 × $1,050). A Social Security beneficiary is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">fully insured</a><span class="glossdef">Status achieved by a Social Security beneficiary once forty credits of coverage are earned, or when the beneficiary has a minimum of six credits of coverage and, if greater, at least as many quarters of coverage as there are years elapsing after 1950 (or after age twenty-one, if later)</span></span> once forty credits of coverage are earned, or when the beneficiary has a minimum of six credits of coverage and, if greater, at least as many quarters of coverage as there are years elapsing after 1950 (or after age twenty-one, if later). For example, a person age twenty-five who has six credits of coverage is fully insured, whereas a person age forty needs nineteen credits to be fully insured. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Currently insured</a><span class="glossdef">Status achieved by a Social Security beneficiary having at least six credits in the thirteen-quarter period ending with the quarter of death.</span></span> status is achieved if the Social Security beneficiary has at least six credits in the thirteen-quarter period ending with the quarter of death. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Disability insured</a><span class="glossdef">Status achieved by a Social Security beneficiary having twenty credits in the ten years before disability begins; less rigorous disability requirements apply to a beneficiary who is under age thirty-one or blind.</span></span> status is gained by the Social Security beneficiary having twenty credits in the ten years before disability begins.

            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_s01_s02_s02_p01">As noted, Social Security pays four types of benefits: old-age (or retirement), survivors’, disability, and Medicare. Following is a more detailed description of each of these benefits.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_s01_s02_s05_p03">We will use the examples provided by the Social Security Administration as a learning tool here. First, we focus on the calculation of the AIME. For each case, we see the columns labeled “nominal earnings.” Indexing brings nominal earnings up to near-current wage levels. For each case, the table shows columns of earnings before and after Indexing. The highest thirty-five years of indexed earnings and the corresponding average monthly amounts of such earnings are used for the benefit computation. The result is the AIME. The indexing requires some special computation. Consequently, there is no easy way to make an estimate of one’s PIA. It is not as simple as finding average wages and consulting a table. The Social Security Administration has computerized wage histories for all workers, and the PIA calculation is made when an application for benefits is processed. The Social Security Administration furnishes annually the calculation of each insured’s PIA. If a person has not received the statement, the Social Security Administration will furnish a record of the historical Social Security earnings and PIA upon request. The Social Security Administration Web site also has an online calculator.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_s01_s02_s05_p04">After the AIME is determined, an individual’s PIA in 2009 would be determined by the formula in <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch18_s01_s02_s05_t02">Table 18.7 "PIA Formula for an Individual in 2009"</a>.

When the family reaches its maximum family benefit, the worker’s benefit is not reduced but the benefits of the survivors or dependents are reduced proportionately. There is also a minimum PIA for very-low-wage workers who have been covered by Social Security for at least ten years.

            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_s01_s03_s01_p01">Social Security benefits are financed through payroll taxes paid by employers and employees and by a special tax on earnings paid by the self-employed. The tax rate for employers and employees is 6.2 percent for OASDI, up to a maximum amount of earnings called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">wage base level</a><span class="glossdef">Specifies the maximum amount of earnings on which Social Security taxation applies.</span></span>, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch18_s01_s03_s01_t01">Table 18.12 "OASDI Annual Wage Base for Tax Purposes"</a>, and 1.45 percent for HI (Medicare Part A) on all earnings. The tax rates scheduled under current law are shown in <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch18_s01_s03_s01_t02">Table 18.13 "Tax Rates Paid on Wages and Earnings"</a>. Those who elect Medicare Part B coverage pay monthly premiums via deductions from their Social Security benefits checks.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_s01_s03_s01_p02">Social Security taxes, sometimes called FICA taxes (after the Federal Insurance Contributions Act of 1939), are automatically withheld on wages up to a set amount and are adjusted annually for inflation. Any wages earned over this wage base are not taxed for Social Security, although Medicare Part A taxes are still deducted.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_s01_s03_s01_p03">The tax rates are intended to remain constant (the last hike was in 1990), but the taxable wage base is adjusted annually to reflect increases in average wages. As you can see in <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch18_s01_s03_s01_t01">Table 18.12 "OASDI Annual Wage Base for Tax Purposes"</a>, the 2008 annual wage base was $102,000, and it is $106,800 in 2009, meaning employers, employees, and the self-employed paid OASDI taxes on individual wages up to the wage base. If wages increase 5 percent the following year, the tax rates would remain the same but the taxable wage base would increase by 5 percent, thus increasing total Social Security tax revenue (all else being equal). Wages beyond the threshold are not subject to the OASDI tax, but they are subject to the Medicare Part A tax.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_s01_s03_s01_p04">Social Security benefits are subject to income taxes. More specifically, taxes are payable on 50 percent of the Social Security benefit by single persons whose taxable incomes (including 50 percent of Social Security benefits and any interest on tax-exempt bonds) are between $25,000 and $34,000 (between $32,000 and $44,000 for married couples filing joint returns). If income exceeds $34,000 for single persons (or $44,000 for married couples filing jointly), up to 85 percent of the Social Security benefit received at retirement as income is taxable.</p>

One trust fund is for retirement and survivors’ benefits; the second is for disability insurance; and the third is for hospital insurance, or Medicare Part A. Medicare Parts B and D, supplementary medical benefits, are financed by monthly premiums from persons enrolled in the program, along with amounts appropriated from the general revenue of the federal government. These funds are deposited in a fourth trust fund, the supplementary medical insurance trust fund.</p>

Local service is provided by offices located in the principal cities and towns of the fifty states and Puerto Rico. Applications for Social Security numbers and the various benefits as well as enrollment for the medical insurance plan (discussed next) are processed by the district office. The administration is set up to help beneficiaries in catastrophic times, as was evident following Hurricane Katrina. Because so many people were displaced, the Social Security Administration created emergency offices and stations to continue immediate payments to the evacuees.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn18_011">Social Security Administration, “Social Security Responds to Hurricane Katrina, Agency Issues More Than 30,000 Emergency Checks to Date,” Social Security Press Release, September 9, 2005, Accessed April 5, 2009, <a class="link" href="http://www.ssa.gov/pressoffice/pr/katrina-pr.html">http://www.ssa.gov/pressoffice/pr/katrina-pr.html</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_s01_s04_p02">Disability determination—the decision whether or not an applicant for disability benefits is disabled as defined in the law—is made by a state agency (usually the vocational rehabilitation agency) under agreements between the state and the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. Qualification for hospital and medical benefits is determined by the district office, but claims for such benefits are processed through private insurer intermediaries under contract with the Social Security Administration.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch18_s01_s04_p03">The first decision concerning a person’s qualification for benefits under the various parts of the program is made at the local level. Simple, effective procedures exist for appeal by any applicant for whom the decision is unsatisfactory. There is no charge for such appeals, and the agency strives to provide courteous assistance to the claimant.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
            <p class="para" id="baranoff-ch18_s01_s04_p04">In this section you studied the features of Social Security, a compulsory social insurance program paying old age, survivors’, and disability (OASD) benefits:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="baranoff-ch18_s01_s04_l01">
                <li>A person must be in the work force a minimum number of quarters, during which earnings must meet minimum amounts to be eligible for Social Security benefits.</li>
                <li>The level of benefit depends on a worker’s status as fully insured, currently insured, or disability insured.</li>
                <li>Fully insured workers, their aged spouses, and dependent children are eligible to receive retirement (old-age) benefits beginning at the worker’s retirement age (which depends on birth year) and disability benefits.</li>
                <li>Benefits are reduced in the case of early retirement and increased in the case of late retirement.</li>
                <li>A fully insured worker under age sixty-five with a medical condition that prevents substantial gainful work can receive <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">disability benefits</a><span class="glossdef">Available to a fully insured worker (and eligible dependents) in Social Security who has a medically determinable physical or mental condition preventing any gainful work after a waiting period of five full months if he or she is under age sixty-five and has been disabled for twelve months, is expected to be disabled for at least twelve months, or has a disability that is expected to result in death.</span></span> after a waiting period if he or she has been disabled for twelve months, is expected to be disabled at least twelve months, or has a disability expected to result in death.</li>
                <li>Survivors (aged spouses, disabled spouses, and dependents) of deceased fully, currently, or disability insured workers are also eligible to receive old-age survivors’ or disability benefits.</li>
                <li>The primary insurance amount (PIA), computed from average indexed monthly earnings (AIME) up to the Social Security wage base, is used to determine the amount of monthly benefits.</li>
                <li>The PIA formula is weighted to help lower-income workers at three different bend points—the sum of these amounts equals the monthly benefit, with COLAs made annually.</li>
                <li>Benefits are subject to (1) a monthly maximum that can be paid on a worker’s earnings record, at which survivors’ benefits are reduced proportionately, and (2) an earnings test, whereby benefits are reduced for retirees whose earned income exceeds the retirement earnings exempt amount.</li>
                <li>Social Security benefits are financed through payroll taxes on employers and employees at 6.2 percent (OASDI) and 1.45 percent (HI) up to the wage base level (adjusted annually).</li>
                <li>Benefits are paid through the Social Security trust fund, which is made up of employment tax revenues, benefit income tax revenues, interest on investments, and other income.</li>
                <li>The Social Security program is a pay-as-you-go system administered by the Social Security Administration (part of the Department of Health and Human Services), with offices to handle applications in each state.</li>

            <ol class="orderedlist" id="baranoff-ch18_s01_s04_l02">
                <li>How does a worker become fully insured under Social Security? What benefits are fully insured workers entitled to?</li>
                <li>Explain the concept of arriving at AIME. How do you compute the PIA?</li>
                <li>How does the earnings test affect Social Security benefits?</li>
                <li>Social Security benefits are financed largely through payroll taxes. The more you earn (up to the maximum earnings base), the more tax you pay. Income benefits, however, favor lower-income workers. Explain why lower-income people are favored.</li>

                    <p class="para">The Baylor Crane Construction Company is a Virginia-based builder with 1,750 full-time and 300 part-time employees. The company provides all the social insurance programs required by law and most standard employee benefits plans. Last year, Baylor Crane suffered a high severity of losses when the top five floors of a high rise collapsed in Virginia Beach during strong winds. Luckily, most workers escaped injuries, except six workers who stayed to secure the building. Three of them sustained severe injuries and Johnny Kendle, the sixty-four-year-old supervisor, was killed. The injured workers are back at work except for Tom Leroy, who is still on disability. His prognosis is not good.</p>
