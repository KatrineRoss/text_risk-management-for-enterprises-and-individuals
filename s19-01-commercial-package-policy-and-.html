    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch15_s01_p02">The commercial package policy (CPP) program was started by the Insurance Services Office (ISO) in 1986. Every policy includes three standard elements: the cover page, common policy conditions, and common declarations (shown in <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch15#baranoff-ch15_f01">Figure 15.1 "Links between the Holistic Risk Puzzle and Commercial Insurance"</a>). It is important to elaborate on the declaration page because it provides a visual aid of the various coverages that can be selected by a business, depending on needs. Some businesses may not need specific parts of the package, but all the elements are listed for the choice of the potential insured. More specifically, the package may include the following commercial coverage elements: boiler and machinery, capital assets program, commercial automobile, commercial general liability, commercial inland marine, commercial property, crime and fidelity, employment-related practices liability, farm liability, liquor liability, pollution liability, and professional liability. Some of these coverages were discussed in prior chapters. The rest of the coverages will be described here.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch15_s01_p03">Most commercial organizations have similar property exposures. Common business property exposures, along with business income exposures, can be insured through the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">commercial property policy</a><span class="glossdef">Policy that provides insurance for direct physical loss to business property and income.</span></span> form of the commercial package policy. The liability module of the commercial package policy is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">commercial general liability (CGL) policy</a><span class="glossdef">The liability module of the commercial package policy.</span></span>. It replaced the liability coverage previously available through the comprehensive general liability policy. In 1986, the CGL was made part of the new modular approach introduced by the ISO in the form of the CPP.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Commercial Property Coverages</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch15_s01_s01_p01">The commercial property policy form of the CPP begins with property declarations and conditions. These provisions identify the covered location, property values (and limits), premiums, deductibles, and other specific aspects of the coverage. These pages make the insurance unique for a given policyholder by identifying that policyholder’s specific exposures. The information in the declarations must be accurate for the desired protection to exist. The remainder of the commercial property coverage consists of the following:</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch15_s01_s01_s01_p01">The BPP provides coverage for direct physical loss to buildings and/or contents as described in the policy. Separate sections with distinct limits of insurance are available for both buildings and contents to account for differing needs of insureds. Some insureds will be tenants who do not need building coverage. Others will be landlords who have limited or no need for contents coverage. Many insureds, of course, will need both in varying degrees.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch15_s01_s01_s01_s01_p01">What constitutes a building and business personal property may appear obvious. The insurer, however, must be very precise in defining its intent because, as you know, insurance is a contract of adhesion. Ambiguities, therefore, are generally construed in favor of the insured. <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch15_s01_s01_s01_s01_f01">Figure 15.2 "Building as Defined in ISO Building and Personal Property Coverage Form (Sample)"</a> lists the items defined as buildings. <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch15_s01_s01_s01_s01_f02">Figure 15.3 "Business Personal Property as Defined in ISO Building and Personal Property Coverage Form (Sample)"</a> lists those items defined as business personal property.</p>

These items are listed in <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch15_s01_s01_s01_s01_f03">Figure 15.4 "Listed Property Not Covered as Defined in ISO Building and Personal Property Coverage Form (Sample)"</a>. Reasons for exclusions in insurance were discussed earlier. Note in <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch15_s01_s01_s01_s01_f03">Figure 15.4 "Listed Property Not Covered as Defined in ISO Building and Personal Property Coverage Form (Sample)"</a> and in the corresponding section in the policy the exclusion of “electronic data, except as provided under additional coverages.” In part f (4) of Additional Coverages, discussed below and in <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch15_s01_s01_s01_s01_f04">Figure 15.5 "Additional Coverage and Coverage Extension as Listed in ISO Building and Personal Property Coverage Form"</a>, the electronic data that is covered is limited to a loss of up to $2,500 sustained in one year. The low limit on electronic equipment and data losses have propelled many businesses to buy the e-commerce endorsement discussed in <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch11#baranoff-ch11">Chapter 11 "Property Risk Management"</a>. This exclusion is not always noticed by businesses. To ensure adequate coverage, insurers began to offer education programs to risk managers about their cyber-risk exposures.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch15_s01_s01_s01_s02_p01">In addition to paying for repair or replacement of the listed property when caused by a covered peril, the BPP pays for other related costs. The BPP also extends coverage under specified conditions. These coverage additions and extensions are listed in <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch15_s01_s01_s01_s01_f04">Figure 15.5 "Additional Coverage and Coverage Extension as Listed in ISO Building and Personal Property Coverage Form"</a>.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch15_s01_s01_s01_s02_p02">The value of these additional and extended coverages can be significant. Debris removal, for example, is a cost that is often overlooked by insureds, but can involve thousands of dollars. Recent tornadoes in the midwestern United States caused heavy property damage, and for many insureds, the most significant costs involved removal of tree limbs and other debris.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch15_s01_s01_s01_s02_p03">An interesting additional coverage is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">pollutant cleanup and removal</a><span class="glossdef">A provision that specifies the conditions under which, and the extent to which, protection for cleanup costs are paid by the insurer.</span></span>, a provision that specifies the conditions under which, and the extent to which, protection for cleanup costs are paid by the insurer. Because of large potential liabilities, coverage is narrowly defined as those situations caused by a covered loss, and only for losses at the described premises. The amount of available protection is also limited.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch15_s01_s01_s01_s02_p04">The extended coverages primarily offer protection for properties not included in the definition of covered buildings and personal property. The intent is to provide specific and limited insurance for these properties, which is why they are separated from the general provision. Newly acquired property and property of others, for instance, involve exposures distinct from the general exposures, and they require special attention in the coverage extensions. Some of the coverage extensions offer protection against loss from a short list of causes to property otherwise excluded. Outdoor equipment is an example of property otherwise excluded.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch15_s01_s01_s01_s03_p01">As has been discussed in prior chapters, property insurance payments may be made on either a replacement cost new (RCN) basis or an actual cash value (ACV) basis. If the insured chooses actual cash value, then the provision 7 valuation of section E, loss conditions, applies. The valuation provision involves a number of parts.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn15_001">A detailed description of this part of the policy is beyond the scope of this text.</span> Parts (b) through (e) explain the insurer’s intent for valuation in situations involving RCN when ACV may be difficult to measure or inappropriate. Part (b), for instance, permits payment at RCN for relatively small losses: those valued at $2,500 or less.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch15_s01_s01_s01_s03_p02">If the insured chooses replacement cost new, this optional coverage must be designated in the declarations. Further, the insured ought to recognize the need for higher limits than if ACV is used. Typically, the insurer does not charge a higher rate for RCN coverage; however, more coverage is needed, which translates into a higher premium. For RCN to be paid, the insured must actually repair or replace the covered property. Otherwise, the insurer will pay on an ACV basis.</p>

            <div class="section" id="baranoff-ch15_s01_s01_s01_s04">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Limits of Insurance</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch15_s01_s01_s01_s04_p01">As just discussed, you need to be cautious when selecting an amount of insurance that will cover your potential losses. The insurer will not pay more than the limit of insurance, except for the coverage extensions and coverage additions (fire department charges, pollution cleanup, and electronic data). In addition to concern over having a sufficient amount of insurance to cover the value of any loss, some insureds need to worry about violation of the coinsurance provision, which is found under section F, additional conditions of the BPP. The policy provides examples of coinsurance. An example of underinsurance in the policy is provided in <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch15_s01_s01_s01_s04_t01">Table 15.1 "Example of Underinsurance in ISO Building and Personal Property Coverage Form (Sample)"</a> below.</p>

Insurance policies cover only certain fires. While excessive heat may be sufficient for the fire protection to apply, oxidation that results in a flame or glow is typically required. Further, the flame must be hostile, not within some intended container. For instance, if you throw something into a fireplace, intentionally or not, that fire is not hostile and the loss likely is not covered.</p>

Geography may dictate, to some extent, preference for the broad form because of its ice and snow coverage. Also note that the water damage peril is for the “sudden and accidental leakage of water or steam that results from the breaking or cracking of part of an appliance or system containing water or steam (not a sprinkler system).” It does not cover floods or other similar types of catastrophic water damage.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch15_s01_s01_s02_s02_p02">In addition to adding these perils, the broad form includes a provision to cover collapse caused by the named perils or by hidden decay; hidden insect or vermin damage; weight of people or personal property; weight of rain that collects on a roof; or use of defective materials in construction, remodeling, or renovation. While this “collapse” additional coverage does not increase the amount of coverage available (as the other additional coverages do), it does expand the list of covered-loss situations.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch15_s01_s01_s02_s02_p07">Returning to the topic of cause of loss, it is very important to have a clear definition of what is considered a cause of loss for the limits of coverage. Whether or not the peril caused one loss or two separate losses is imperative in understanding the policy. A case in point is that of the complex decisions regarding whether the loss of the two World Trade Center buildings was one loss or two separate losses from two separate causes of loss. The stakes were very high, at $3.5 billion of limit. To understand the issue more clearly, see the box “Liability Limits: One Event or Two?”</p>

                    <h3 class="title">Liability Limits: One Event or Two?</h3>
                    <p class="para" id="baranoff-ch15_s01_s01_s02_s02_p08">Did the September 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center constitute one loss or two? The resolution to this question is far from simple. Controversy surrounding this issue illustrates the ambiguities inherent in some business insurance contracts.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="baranoff-ch15_s01_s01_s02_s02_p09">When the two hijacked airplanes struck the World Trade Center towers on the morning of September 11, 2001, the insurance and reinsurance contracts for the property were still under binder agreements. Thus, the wording of the binder agreements became the central issue of this case. At the time of the attacks, real estate executive Larry A. Silverstein’s company had only recently acquired a ninety-nine-year lease on the World Trade Center and had not yet finalized insurance coverage, which provided up to $3.5 billion in property and liability damage per occurrence. With policies of such size, which have large reinsurance requirements, it is not uncommon for the final policies not to be in place when the insured begins operations.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="baranoff-ch15_s01_s01_s02_s02_p10">The United Kingdom-based reinsurer Swiss Re had agreed to underwrite 22 percent of coverage on the property once the loss exceeded $10 million, translating into $3.5 billion per occurrence in this case. After the attacks, Swiss Re argued that its preliminary agreement with the lessee defined occurrence as “all losses or damages that are attributable directly or indirectly to one cause or one series of similar causes” and that “all such losses will be added together and the total amount of such losses will be treated as one occurrence irrespective of the period of time or area over which such losses occur.” Silverstein, however, argued that each of the airplane crashes was a separate occurrence and his company was due more than $7 billion for the two attacks.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="baranoff-ch15_s01_s01_s02_s02_p11">The fuzziness of the language has been very problematic. This led to two opposing verdicts in separate court cases. In Phase I, the insurers prevailed. In Phase II, Silverstein did. The first jury found that “the form used by broker Willis Group Holdings Ltd., rather than a rival form used by Travelers or other forms, and that the Willis form, known as WilProp 2000, had specific language that defined what happened to the World Trade Center as a single occurrence.” Under this WilProp form, occurrence means “all losses or damages that are attributable directly or indirectly to one cause or to one series of similar causes. All such losses are added together and the total amount of such losses is treated as one occurrence irrespective of the period of time or area over which such losses occur.”</p>
                    <p class="para" id="baranoff-ch15_s01_s01_s02_s02_p12">In the second case, the jury agreed with Silverstein that there were two occurrences, at least as defined by the temporary insurance agreements that bound the group of insurers that were involved in the second case. As a result of the second ruling, Silverstein had an open door to collect “as much as twice the $1.1 billion aggregate insured amount per occurrence for which the nine insurers were liable.”</p>
                    <p class="para" id="baranoff-ch15_s01_s01_s02_s02_p13">These two contradictory rulings stem from three tests:
						</p>
<ol class="orderedlist" id="baranoff-ch15_s01_s01_s02_s02_l01">                            <li>The cause test—The question is, Was there more than one cause underlying the loss? As such, it can be determined that the fall of the twin towers resulted from one conspiracy by Osama bin Laden.</li>
                            <li>The effect test (less prevalent)—The question is, Was there more than one distinct loss? As such, the test looks at each injury or damage to determine the number of losses.</li>
                            <li>Unfortunate events test—This test combines the cause test with elements of the effect test; here, proximity of the cause of loss is important. Because there were two planes causing the loss, the loss is regarded as two separate losses.</li>
</ol>
					
                    <p class="para" id="baranoff-ch15_s01_s01_s02_s02_p14">The World Trade Center cases were heard in a federal court—the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in Manhattan. Ultimately, however, the matter was settled out of court. In March of 2007, New York Insurance Superintendent Eric Dinallo requested that two representatives from Silverstein Properties and each of the seven insurers involved in the WTC settlement dispute attend a meeting with the state insurance department to bring closure to the ongoing litigation. After weeks of tense negotiations, then-New York Governor Eliot Spitzer and Superintendent Dinallo announced on May 23, 2007, that an agreement between the parties had been successfully brokered. Travelers, Zurich, Swiss RE, Employers Insurance of Wausau, Allianz Global, Industrial Risk Insurers, and Royal Indemnity Company agreed to settle all outstanding court cases and related proceedings for a total of $2 billion. Spitzer and Dinallo described this as the largest settlement in regulatory history. Specific amounts paid each company were not disclosed due to confidentiality agreements. The resolution to this dispute removes the last major obstacle to World Trade Center redevelopment as planned by Silverstein Properties and the New York and New Jersey Port Authority.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="baranoff-ch15_s01_s01_s02_s02_p15">To address the underlying problem in the long-delayed loss settlement, Superintendent Dinallo issued a bulletin on October 16, 2008, requiring insurers to provide contract certainty for coverage agreements. This contract certainty called for contract language in insurance policies to be firmed up within thirty days of issuance and the delivery of the policy before, on, or promptly after the policy’s inception date. This would ensure that policy provisions, like the question as to whether the destruction of the twin towers was one insured event or two, are definitively established before a loss. Insurance carriers were given twelve months from the date of Dinallo’s bulletin to bring policies and procedures into compliance with the rule. When asked by the Risk and Insurance Management Society (RIMS) what would happen if carriers failed to meet the compliance deadline, the New York Insurance Department responded that it would “consider regulations spelling out more detailed rules. Regulations have the force of law and penalties can be assessed on licensees.” Willis Group Holdings Chairman and CEO Joe Plumeri praised the contract certainty rule, saying, “There is absolutely no excuse for policies to be delivered months after their inception, an all too commonplace practice in this business.… We’re in the business of keeping promises, and the insurance industry as a whole can do no less. We believe that the industry should police itself, take a principled approach to doing business, and adopt these measures as soon as possible.”</p>
                    <p class="para" id="baranoff-ch15_s01_s01_s02_s02_p16">The protracted settlement of the World Trade Center destruction provides a high-profile example of the problems that can arise due to uncertain policy terms. This is not typically an issue with most insurance policies written on standardized forms approved by the state insurance department. In the case of large commercial clients, excess and surplus lines, and reinsurance markets, however, it is likely to come up due to complexity of business scope, degree of risk, and lack of regulatory authority. Should the contract certainty rule in New York prove successful in curtailing disputes, RIMS anticipates that additional states will follow suit in passing similar requirements.</p>

You may recall that theft is not a listed peril in the broad or the basic form. Coverage of theft from any cause, however, is too costly for most policyholders. The special form, therefore, includes some limitations on this protection. For instance, employee dishonesty and loss of property that appears to have been stolen but for which there is no physical evidence of theft (“mysterious disappearance”) are not covered. In addition, certain types of property such as patterns, dyes, furs, jewelry, and tickets are covered against theft only up to specified amounts. The special form also provides coverage for property in transit.</p>

These extra expenses are also covered by the BIC. A bank, for example, could not simply shut down operations if a fire destroyed its building because the bank’s customers rely on having ready access to financial services. As a result, the bank is likely to set up operations at a temporary location (thus reducing the extent of lost revenues) while the damaged property is being repaired. The rent at the temporary location plus any increase in other expenses would be considered covered extra expenses.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch15_s01_s01_s03_s04_p02">Remember that a BIC loss equals net income plus continuing operating expenses. Coinsurance, however, applies to net income plus all operating expenses, a larger value. The amount of insurance required to meet the coinsurance provision is some percentage of this value, with the percentage determined by what the insured expects to be the maximum period of interruption. If a maximum interruption of six months is expected, for example, the proper coinsurance percentage is 50 percent (6/12). If it is nine months, a coinsurance percentage of 75 percent (9/12) is appropriate.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch15_s01_s01_s03_s04_p03">Because of the complexity of the coinsurance provision, however, many insureds choose an agreed value option. This option works under the same principles as those discussed with regard to the BPP. Using the example illustrated in “Business Income Coverage (BIC) Hypothetical Loss,” we can demonstrate the application of the coinsurance provision. Coinsurance requirements apply to net income plus operating expenses ($95,000 plus $405,000 per month on average, or $6,000,000 for the year). If a 50 percent coinsurance provision is used because the expected maximum period of interruption is six months, then the amount of insurance required is $3,000,000 (0.50 × $6,000,000). If the April figures are representative (which is really not the case with a tax accounting office), then a six-month interruption would result in a much lower loss.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch15_s01_s01_s03_s05_p01">The BIC includes a number of options designed to modify coverage for the insured’s specific needs. Three options that affect the coinsurance provision are the monthly limit of indemnity, maximum period of indemnity, and payroll endorsements. For better understanding, the student is invited to read the policy in addition to reading the following explanations.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch15_s01_s01_s03_s05_p02">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">monthly limit of indemnity</a><span class="glossdef">Negates the coinsurance provision of business income coverage; instead, a total limit is listed, as is the percentage of that limit available each month.</span></span> negates the coinsurance provision of business income coverage; instead, a total limit is listed, as is the percentage of that limit available each month. The policy uses the example of a $120,000 limit and ¼ monthly amount. For this example, only $30,000 (¼ × $120,000) is available each month. An organization with stable earnings and expectations of a short period of restoration would likely find this option worthwhile.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch15_s01_s01_s03_s05_p03">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">maximum period of indemnity</a><span class="glossdef">Option also negates the coinsurance provision of the BIC; instead, this option limits the duration of coverage to 120 days (or until the limit is reached, whichever comes first).</span></span> option also negates the coinsurance provision of the BIC; instead, this option limits the duration of coverage to 120 days (or until the limit is reached, whichever comes first). Both the maximum period of indemnity and the monthly limit of indemnity address the fact that the standard policy cannot be used with a coinsurance provision of less than 50 percent (six months).</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch15_s01_s01_s03_s05_p04">Instead of negating the coinsurance provision, as do the two options just discussed, the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">payroll endorsement</a><span class="glossdef">Allows the insured to deduct some or all payroll expenses from the value of operating expenses before calculating the coinsurance requirement.</span></span> allows the insured to deduct some or all payroll expenses from the value of operating expenses before calculating the coinsurance requirement. Doing so allows the insured to purchase less insurance (and usually pay lower premiums) and still meet the coinsurance provision. It also excludes payroll from covered expenses, however, so the insured must feel confident that payroll would not be maintained during a shutdown. A common payroll endorsement includes ninety days of payroll expense in the coinsurance calculation (and BIC coverage), assuming that a short shutdown might allow the insured to continue to pay employees. For a longer shutdown, termination of employment might be more cost effective.</p>

                        <li>The commercial package policy (CPP) is a modular business insurance option that bundles coverages such as commercial property, commercial general liability, commercial inland marine, professional liability, and more, into a single policy.</li>
                        <li>The CPP contains the standard elements: cover page, common policy conditions, and common declarations.</li>
                        <li>Common business property exposures are insured through the commercial property policy of the CPP.</li>
                        <li>Property declarations and conditions of the commercial property policy form identify the covered location, property values and limits, premiums, deductibles, and other items.</li>
                        <li>The commercial property policy’s building and personal property (BPP) form provides coverage for direct physical loss to buildings and contents and additional or extended coverages, per the insured’s valuation provision up to the limits of insurance and subject to listed exclusions.</li>
                        <li>Three causes of loss options are available in the BPP: basic (eleven named perils), broad (fifteen named perils), and special (open perils), all subject to exclusions.</li>
                        <li>The commercial property policy provides coverage of net income losses as a result of being unable to use damaged or lost property through the business income coverage (BIC) form.</li>
                        <li>BIC protects against business interruption and extra expense losses.</li>
                        <li>The BIC offers the same three cause of loss options as the BPP.</li>
                        <li>Both the BPP and the BIC are subject to coinsurance provisions; this can be modified in the BIC through use of the monthly limit of indemnity, maximum period of indemnity, and payroll endorsements.</li>
