        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s02_s01_p01">This case, like Case 1, is a group project that is part of employee benefits classes taught by the author of this textbook. Following is the employee benefits portfolio of a compilation of the ten groups of the fall 2002 class (and some of the fall 2000 class), in the words of the students.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn23_005">The work of the following students is reflected in this case: Donna Biddick, Lavonnia Bragg, Katrina Brand, Heather Cartes, Robert Cloud, Maria Conway, Thomas Dabney Clay, Lillian Dunlevy, Daniel Fleming, Shannon Fowlkes, Caroline Garrett, Barbara Guill, Steven Hall, Georgette Harris, Shirelle Harris, Tyron Hinton, Tiffany Jefferson, Tennille McCarter, Pamela Nicholson, Hiren Patel, Susan Shaban, Carolyn Shelburne, Gaurav Shrestha, Stephanie Soucy, Christopher Speight, Cassandra Townsend, Geoff Watkins, and Tresha White, from fall 2002. Also included is the work of Margaret Maslak and Shelisa Artis from fall 2000.</span> The case is a typical project that lasts for the students throughout the semester. The students present portions of the case as the material is covered in class. In most cases, the whole employee benefits portfolio of the hypothetical company created by the students is presented at the conclusion of the semester as part of the final grade. This case does not provide a long-term care coverage plan. Most of the retirement plans offered by the hypothetical employers of these projects are not realistic in terms of the amounts and variety. The students are requested to provide a defined benefit plan, a defined contribution plan, and a 401(k) plan in order to experience the workings of these plans. The students did not offer a complete cafeteria plan—only a flexible spending account.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn23_006">The students used information from the following companies and sources: Dominion Co., <a class="link" href="http://www.dominion.com">www.dominion.com</a>; Dominion Virginia Power, <a class="link" href="http://www.dom.com/">http://www.dom.com/</a>; Phillip Morris, USA, <a class="link" href="http://www.philipmorrisusa.com/en/cms/Home/default.aspx">http://www.philipmorrisusa.com/en/cms/Home/default.aspx</a>; Virginia Retirement System, <a class="link" href="http://www.state.va.us/vrs/vrs-home-htm">www.state.va.us/vrs/vrs-home-htm</a>; Henrico County, Virginia, <a class="link" href="http://www.co.henrico.va.us.">www.co.henrico.va.us.</a>; Minnesota Life, <a class="link" href="http://www.minnesotalife.com">www.minnesotalife.com</a>; A.

Money deposited in these accounts is not taxed when it goes into the accounts or when it is paid back to you. Employees can use these pretax dollars to pay for miscellaneous items such as eyeglasses or unreimbursed medical/dental expenses. This plan also allows employees to pay dependent care expenses with pretax dollars. Any amount not spent at the end of the plan year is forfeited by the employee (use it or lose it). See <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch23_s02_s03_s08_t01">Table 23.19 "Summary of FSA: Major Plan Provisions"</a> for details.

When you die, benefits continue to be paid to your designated beneficiary, assuming your beneficiary survives you. Written spousal consent is required before you can designate a beneficiary other than your spouse. Benefits are reduced for the survivorship option because payments will be made over two lives rather than one. Payments depend on your age and your beneficiary’s age when you begin receiving payments. If you choose the survivorship option and your beneficiary dies before you do, your payment will be increased to the amount that you would have received under the single life option. Additionally, you may choose the amount (50 percent, 75 percent, or 100 percent) your surviving beneficiary will receive after you die.</p>

Once you become a participant, we evaluate your eligible compensation (base pay, commissions, and bonuses) and the eligible compensation of all Galaxy Max employees. Your portion of the amount of profits we contribute is the proportion of your eligible compensation to that of all employees. For example, suppose that Galaxy Max will contribute $200,000 to the profit-sharing plan, your eligible compensation is $35,000, and the eligible compensation of all employees is $950,000. Your share would be $35,000/$950,000, or 3.68 percent, of $200,000. Therefore, the allocation to your account would be $7,368.42. These numbers are used only as an example.

                <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s02_s04_s04_s06_p01">You begin earning ownership rights to your account once you complete three continuous years of service. After your second full year, you are 20 percent vested, and you earn another 20 percent each year. Once you complete six years of service, you are fully vested. If your employment ends because you become permanently disabled, die, or leave Galaxy Max after age sixty-five with at least five years of service, you and your beneficiary will be entitled to receive the full value of your account, regardless of your vesting. The vesting schedule for profit-sharing plan contributions is presented in <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch23_s02_s04_s04_s06_t01">Table 23.24 "Galaxy Max Profit-Sharing Contribution Vesting Schedule"</a> below.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s02_s04_s04_s10_p01">For all three plans, certain legal limits are placed on contributions to your account. The combined annual contributions to your retirement plans cannot exceed $40,000 or 100 percent of your compensation, whichever is lower. This limit applies to both your and Galaxy Max’s contributions to your 401(k), profit-sharing, and defined benefit plans, unless the defined benefit plan requires (under the minimum required annual contribution) a greater annual contribution. Thus, in summary, all qualified retirement plans combined cannot exceed the $40,000 or 100 percent of compensation annual limit, unless more contribution is necessary to meet the minimum requirements under the defined benefit plans.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
            <p class="para" id="baranoff-ch23_s02_s05_p02">In this section you studied the employee benefits package of a hypothetical company (Galaxy Max, Inc.):</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="baranoff-ch23_s02_s05_l01">
                <li>Each group benefit option in an employee benefits program is explained in terms of benefits, eligibility, enrollment requirements, waiting periods, employee costs, coverage exclusions, benefit providers, tax implications, and plan termination provisions.</li>
                <li>Employees are able to add beneficiaries and dependents (subject to eligibility requirements) for applicable benefits.</li>
                <li>Life insurance at one-time employees’ annual salary is a typical group benefit, with options to purchase supplemental coverage wholly funded by employees.</li>
                <li>Sick leave and short- and long-term disability options may be partially subsidized by employers, with options for employees to purchase supplemental long-term coverage.</li>
                <li>Group health insurance usually includes a mix of HMO, PPO, or high-deductible options provided at costs shared by employer and employee.</li>
                <li>Flexible spending accounts are offered within a cafeteria plan or as a stand-alone option to help employees pay for qualified out-of-pocket costs with pretax dollars.</li>
                <li>Retirement plans can be a combination of a traditional defined benefit plan and various defined contribution plans.</li>
                <li>A benefits package should explain the benefit or contribution formula of retirement plans, include payment options, clarify the requirements of early withdrawals or loans, define normal retirement age (and implications of early retirement), and stipulate vesting provisions.</li>
                <li>Limits apply to retirement plan contributions by employers and employees; benefit plans should give an understanding of employees’ contributions and investment options.</li>
            </ul>
