    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s02_p02">This chapter, as noted above, introduces areas that are growing in importance in the world of insurance. Almost every home, family, and business has risk exposures because of the use of computers, the Internet, and the Web; we refer to this as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">e-commerce property risk</a><span class="glossdef">Business risk exposures due to of the use of computers, the Internet, and the Web.</span></span>. Think about your own courses at the university. Each professor emphasizes his or her communication with you on the Web site for the course. You use the Internet as a research tool. Every time you log on, you are exposed to risks from cyberspace. Most familiar to you is the risk of viruses. But there are many additional risk exposures from electronic business, both to you as an individual and to businesses. Businesses with a Web presence are those that offer professional services online and/or online purchasing. Some businesses are business to consumer (BTC); others are business to business (BTB).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s02_p03">Regardless of the nature of the use of the Internet, cyber attacks have become more frequent and have resulted in large financial losses. According to the 2002 Computer Security Institute/Federal Bureau of Investigation (CSI/FBI) Computer Crime and Security Survey, Internet-related losses increased from $100 million in 1997 to $456 million in 2002.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn11_003">Richard Power, “Computer Security Issues &amp; Trends,” Vol. VIII, Mo I. The survey was conducted by the Computer Security Institute (CSI) with the participation of the San Francisco Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Computer Intrusion Squad. Established in 1974, CSI has thousands of members worldwide and provides a wide variety of information and education programs to assist in protecting the information assets of corporations and governmental organizations. For more information, go to <a class="link" href="http://www.gocsi.com">http://www.gocsi.com</a>.</span> The 6th Annual CyberSource fraud survey indicated a $700 million increase (37 percent) in lost revenue in 2004, from an estimated $2.6 billion in 2003. Small and medium businesses were hit the hardest. These losses are in line with fast revenue growth from e-commerce.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn11_004">The 6th Annual CyberSource Fraud Survey was sponsored by CyberSource Corporation and undertaken by Mindwave Research. The survey was fielded September 17 through October 1, 2004, and yielded 348 qualified and complete responses (versus 333 the year before). The sample was drawn from a database of companies involved in electronic commerce activities. Copies of the survey are available by visiting <a class="link" href="http://www.cybersource.com/fraudreport/">http://www.cybersource.com/fraudreport/</a>.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s02_p04">Businesses today are becoming aware of their e-commerce risk exposures. In every forum of insurers’ meetings and in every insurance media, e-risk exposure is discussed as one of the major “less understood” risk exposures.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn11_005">For example, see Lee McDonald,” Insurer Points out Risks of E-Commerce,” <em class="emphasis">Best’s Review</em>, February 2000; Ron Lent, “Electronic Risk Gives Insurers Pause,” <em class="emphasis">National Underwriter</em>, Property &amp; Casualty/Risk &amp; Benefits Management Edition, May 7, 2001; Caroline Saucer, “Technological Advances: Web Site Design Provides Clues to Underwriting Online Risks,” <em class="emphasis">Best’s Review</em>, December 2000.</span> In this chapter, we discuss the hazards and perils of e-commerce risk exposure to the business itself as the first party. In <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch12#baranoff-ch12">Chapter 12 "The Liability Risk Management"</a>, we will discuss the liability side of the risk exposure of businesses due to the Internet and online connections. Next, we discuss the hazards and perils of electronic business in general.</p>
    <div class="section" id="baranoff-ch11_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Causes of Loss in E-Commerce</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s02_s01_p01">The 2004 CSI/FBI survey provided many categories of the causes of losses in the computer/electronic systems area. By frequency, the 2004 order of causes of losses were: virus (78 percent); insider abuse of net access (59 percent); laptop/mobile thefts (49 percent); unauthorized access to information (39 percent); system penetration (37 percent); denial of service (17 percent); theft of proprietary information (10 percent); and sabotage, financial fraud, and telecom fraud (less than 10 percent). This list does not account for the severity of losses in 2004; however, the 269 respondents to this section of the survey reported losses reaching $141.5 million.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s02_s01_p02">The 2004 CSI/FBI survey covered a wide spectrum of risk exposure in e-commerce, for both first-party (property and business interruption) and third-party (liability losses, covered in <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch12#baranoff-ch12">Chapter 12 "The Liability Risk Management"</a>) losses. As you can see from this summary of the survey and other sources, the causes of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">e-commerce property risks</a><span class="glossdef">Business risk exposures due to of the use of computers, the Internet, and the Web.</span></span> are numerous. We can group these risks into five broad categories:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s02_s01_l01">
            <li>Hardware and software thefts (information asset losses and corruption due to hackers, vandalism, and viruses)</li>

        <div class="section" id="baranoff-ch11_s02_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Hardware and Software Thefts</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s02_s01_s01_p01">Companies have rapidly become dependent on computers. When a company’s computer system is down, regardless of the cause, the company risks losing weeks, months, or possibly years of data. Businesses store the majority of their information on computers. Customer databases, contact information, supplier information, order forms, and almost all documents a company uses to conduct business are stored on the computer system. Losses from theft of proprietary information, sabotage of data networks, or telecom eavesdropping can cause major losses to the infrastructure base of a business, whether it is done by outside hackers or by insider disgruntled employees.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s02_s01_s01_p02">Hackers and crackers can cause expensive, if not fatal, damage to a company’s computer systems. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Hackers</a><span class="glossdef">Virtual vandals who try to poke holes in a company’s security network.</span></span> are virtual vandals who try to poke holes in a company’s security network.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn11_006">George S.

            <h2 class="title editable block">Technological Changes</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s02_s01_s02_p01">Another risk companies face in the cyber world is the rapid advancement of technology. When a company updates its computer system, its software package, or the process for conducting business using the computer system, business is interrupted while employees learn how to conduct business using the new system. The result of this downtime is lost revenue.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="baranoff-ch11_s02_s01_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Regulatory and Legal Changes</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s02_s01_s03_p01">Almost as quickly as the Internet is growing, the government is adding and changing applicable e-commerce laws. In the past, there were few laws because the Internet was not fully explored nor fully understood, but now, laws and regulations are mounting. Thus, companies engaged in e-commerce face legal risks arising from governmental involvement. An example of a law that is likely to change is the tax-free Internet sale. There is no sales tax imposed on merchants (and hence the consumer) on Internet sales between states partly because the government has not yet determined how states should apportion the tax revenue. As the volume of online purchases increases, so do the consequences of lost sales tax revenue from e-commerce.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch11_s02_s01_s03_p02">Lack of qualified lawyers to handle cases that arise out of e-commerce disputes is another new risk. There are many areas of e-law that lawyers are not yet specialized in. Not only are laws complex and tedious, they are also changing rapidly. As a result, it is difficult for lawyers to stay abreast of each law that governs and regulates cyberspace.</p>

                    <li>E-commerce property risks fall under five categories: hardware and software thefts, technological changes, regulatory and legal changes, trademark infringements, and Internet-based telephony crimes</li>
                    <li>Cyber attacks have become more frequent and more costly in the financial losses they cause</li>
                    <li>Hackers, crackers, insiders, and viruses are major causes of hardware and software theft and data losses</li>
                    <li>Technological advancements cause downtime while employees learn how to use new systems and components</li>
                    <li>Frequent additions to and changes in existing e-commerce laws creates compliance risks and lack of qualified lawyers to handle disputes.</li>
                    <li>Domain name hijacking, cybersquatting, and Web site hijacking are all ways of infringing legitimate companies’ trademarks</li>
                    <li>Voice-over-Internet protocol (VoIP) has inherent vulnerabilities due to the absence of effective security measures</li>
                    <li>Loss-control steps that can reduce e-commerce property risks include security products, system audits, backup systems, and data protection</li>
                    <li>While electronic data is considered property, it is typically excluded from standard commercial insurance policies, thus leading to the rise of customized e-commerce policies and endorsements</li>
                </ul>
