            <p class="para">Anna Claire’s Costumes, Inc., has experienced medical benefit cost increases of 16 and 19 percent over the last two years. The benefits manager believes that high hospitalization rates and unnecessarily long hospital stays may explain these increases. The company wants to control costs by reducing hospitalization costs.</p>

            <p class="para">Marguerite Thomas, a Canadian, and Margaret Phythian, a Minnesotan, each tried to convince the other that the health care system in her respective country was superior. In Canada, Marguerite enjoys nationalized health care, where everyone is covered. She does not worry that she may need care she can’t afford. She is willing to pay the taxes necessary to support the system. She doesn’t mind waiting several weeks to get certain elective procedures done because she knows that everyone is getting the care they need and she is willing to wait her turn. Margaret, however, likes the high-quality, high-tech care available to her in the Twin Cities area through her employer-provided HMO. She gets high-quality care and never needs to wait for treatment. She also likes the lower tax rate she pays, partly because the U.S. government isn’t funding a nationalized health care system.</p>
