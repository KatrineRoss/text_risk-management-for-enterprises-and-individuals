<span class="title-prefix">17.6</span> Appendix: How Much Life Insurance to Buy?</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch17_s06_p01">In this section, the income continuation needs for a single-parent family, the Dowds, will be evaluated to see how much life insurance is necessary. Although the various types of life insurance products will be discussed at length in <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch19#baranoff-ch19">Chapter 19 "Mortality Risk Management: Individual Life Insurance and Group Life Insurance"</a>, this exercise is intended to satisfy the needs analysis approach to dealing with mortality risk. The risk management component of the financial planning process will be used to look at the family’s present resources, income needs, and insurance needs in the event of the wage earner’s death. Coverages for property and casualty, health, disability, and retirement are covered in Case 1 of <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch23#baranoff-ch23">Chapter 23 "Cases in Holistic Risk Management"</a>.</p>
    <div class="section" id="baranoff-ch17_s06_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Data Collection</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch17_s06_s01_s01_p01">The Dowd family has three members:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="baranoff-ch17_s06_s01_s01_l01">
            <li>Sharon, age thirty-five</li>
            <li>Liz, age six</li>
            <li>Bob, age four</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch17_s06_s01_s01_p02">Liz and Bob see a pediatrician at least once a year. Sharon had a routine checkup about six months ago. All three are apparently healthy.</p>
        <div class="section" id="baranoff-ch17_s06_s01_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Financial Situation</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch17_s06_s01_s01_s01_p01">Sharon is a branch bank manager whose gross yearly income is $50,000. Her former husband lives in another state and does not pay alimony or contribute to child support.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch17_s06_s01_s01_s01_p02">A balance sheet and cash flow statement are important in evaluating Sharon’s current ability to meet her needs and in establishing postloss objectives. Sharon has constructed <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch17_s06_s01_s01_s01_t01">Table 17.7 "Sharon Dowd’s Balance Sheet (End of Year Market Value)"</a> and <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch17_s06_s01_s01_s01_t02">Table 17.8 "Sharon Dowd’s Annual Cash Flow Statement"</a>. On the balance sheet, you may wonder why the value of furniture and other personal property is only $10,000. The sums listed are liquidation values; these items probably have a replacement value between $30,000 and $40,000. But our concern, in the event of Sharon’s death, is how much the items would sell for if they had to be liquidated to meet family income needs. Unlike houses and automobiles, limited demand exists for used furniture and clothing.</p>

However, Sharon has not formally created a legal document expressing this wish. Kay and Robert have three small children of their own, and Sharon would not want her children to be a financial burden to them. Taking care of her children’s nonfinancial needs is all that Sharon expects from Kay and Robert.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch17_s06_s01_s02_s01_p02">Sharon’s values influence her objectives. Her parents paid almost all her expenses, including the upkeep of a car while she earned a bachelor’s degree. Sharon recognizes that her children are currently benefiting from her above-average income. When they reach college, she wants them to concentrate on their studies and enjoy extracurricular activities without having to work during the academic year. They would be expected to work during the summers to earn part of their spending money for school. Sharon decides that, if she dies prematurely, she wants to provide $12,000 per year before taxes for each child through age seventeen, when they will graduate from high school, both having been born in August. During their four years of college, Sharon wants $18,000 per year available for each child. She realizes that inflation can devastate a given level of income in only a few years. Thus, she wants her expressed objectives to be fulfilled in real (uninflated) dollars. We will present a simple planning solution to this problem.</p>

Sharon plans for much of this money to be spent by her sister and brother-in-law for her children’s food, utilities, transportation, child care, school expenses, and other basic needs. She does not plan for her children to have excessive amounts of spending money. During college, each child has $18,000 per year, which will provide financial access to modestly priced private colleges and out-of-state universities. The maximum annual need of $36,000 per year, depicted in <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch17_s06_s01_s03_s02_f01">Figure 17.9 "Family Income Objectives If Sharon Dies—Hypothetical Data (Social Security Amounts Are Not Actual)"</a>, occurs during the last two years of Liz’s planned college period, when it is assumed that Bob will have begun college.

            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch17_s06_s01_s03_s02_p06">What are the problems with saying that $268,800 is needed to fulfill Sharon’s objectives, assuming she dies now? Reviewing our list of seven complications, we can recognize two major problems. First, inflation is likely to increase her nominal (inflated dollar) needs. Current Social Security legislation provides for annual benefit increases to reflect the lesser of either inflation or wage increases over time. Thus, we can assume that real-dollar Social Security benefits will increase approximately at the rate of inflation. Our concern becomes the effect of inflation on the gap between total income needs and Social Security. In the first year, we know this gap is $9,600. If there is 4 percent inflation, the gap in nominal dollars would be $13,664 by the beginning of the tenth year and $64,834 by the beginning of the sixteenth year, the second year when both Liz and Bob are expected to be in college. Our $268,800 total understates the nominal dollar need substantially.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch17_s06_s01_s03_s02_p07">Second, we have ignored the opportunity to invest the lump-sum insurance benefits (existing and yet to be purchased) and net worth. With such an opportunity, investment earnings would provide part of the future cash flow needs. Unlike the possibility of inflation, the failure to recognize this time value of money overstates the size of the gaps.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch17_s06_s01_s03_s02_p08">Sharon may use the $268,800 figure depicted above if she is willing to assume that the net return on investments will be just sufficient to cover the rate of expected inflation. This is not an unrealistic assumption for the conservative investor, who would make low-to-medium risk/low-to-medium expected return investments. Relatively conservative investments may be suitable when the purpose is the safety of the principal that is invested with the objective of supporting two children following the death of the person who is their sole financial support (other than Social Security). The static life insurance planning technique produces approximate, rather than exact, estimates of death needs.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch17_s06_s01_s03_s02_p09">At this point, we have only estimated Sharon’s gross death needs for the family dependency period.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch17_s06_s01_s03_s05_p01">Are Sharon’s current net worth and life insurance adequate to meet her objectives if she dies now? From the balance sheet provided earlier, we know that she has a net worth of $39,500.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn17_013">It is feasible that all furniture, jewelry, and so on would be liquidated. In a two-parent family, the surviving spouse might want to retain the house and all furnishings.</span> This is a liquidation value that is the net of sales commissions, depreciation, and other value-reducing factors. Her current life insurance consists of a $100,000 term policy through her employer and a $15,000 individual policy. The proceeds from the individual policy will be $11,000 after the insurer deducts the $4,000 loan. Her automobile loan will be paid by credit life insurance. We show this loan repayment below as a life insurance resource. Sharon’s net needs after recognizing existing resources are as follows:</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch17_s06_s01_s03_s06_p01">Sharon could resolve this $119,300 shortage in one of three ways. First, she could reevaluate her objectives, decide to lower the amount of financial support for Liz and Bob, and calculate a lower total. Second, she could decide to tighten her budget and increase her savings/investment program. Third, she could buy an additional life insurance policy in the amount of, let’s say, $125,000. Life insurance premiums would vary upward from approximately $175 for next year for an annual renewable term policy to higher amounts for other types of insurance. Buying additional life insurance is probably Sharon’s best option. Savings as an alternative to life insurance is not a good solution because she could die before contributing much to her savings program. Nevertheless, she should continue to save.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Other Life Insurance Planning Issues</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch17_s06_s01_s03_s07_p01">Sharon’s situation certainly does not cover all planning possibilities. For example, a person with a disabled child might want to extend the family dependency period far beyond age twenty-two. Another person might want to contribute to a spouse’s support for the remainder of his or her life. In this case, a good option is using the life insurance planning technique to quantify the need up to an advanced age, such as sixty-five, and getting price quotations on a life annuity for the remainder of the person’s lifetime.</p>
