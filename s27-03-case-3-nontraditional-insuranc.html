        <h2 class="title editable block">Introduction</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s04_s02_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Alternative risk financing</a><span class="glossdef">Risk-funding arrangements that typically apply to losses above a firm’s primary self-insurance retentions or losses above the primary insurance layer.</span></span> (sometimes referred to as alternative risk transfer) are risk-funding arrangements that typically apply to losses that are above the primary self-insurance retentions or losses above the primary insurance layer. Because of the complexities in designing these programs, they are utilized for solving the problems of large clients, and they merit substantial premiums.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s04_s02_p02">Alternative risk transfer is an evolving area of risk finance where programs are often tailored for the individual company. Insurers have been expanding their offerings and creativity in designing methods of financing corporate risk. This new generation of financing risk is becoming more and more mainstream as more experience is gained by insurers, brokers, and risk managers.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s04_s02_p03">	An analogy between alternative medicine and alternative risk financing is made to demonstrate the importance of such insurance programs. The evolution of alternative risk transfer holds a striking parallel to that of alternative medicine. Individuals and the medical community began turning to alternative medicine when conventional methods failed. Alternative risk transfer is not much different. Risk managers looked for alternatives when the conventional insurance markets failed to satisfy their needs. When availability and affordability issues became prevalent in the insurance markets,<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn23_009">Recall the explanation of the underwriting cycles described in <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch08#baranoff-ch08">Chapter 8 "Insurance Markets and Regulation"</a> of the text. Also, remember that this case was prepared in 1996–1997 during the end tail of a long soft market condition.</span> risk managers resorted to higher retention levels and creative methods of risk financing. In this process, corporations’ risk tolerance levels increased, as did the expertise and comfort level of risk managers in managing risk. Consequently, they did not rush back into the market when it softened. Many of today’s risk managers are protecting themselves from being at the mercy of the insurance industry. A long period of softness in the 1990s also put the buyers in the driver’s seat and the buyers have been demanding products that align more closely with their company’s needs. No longer was alternative risk financing created to heal availability and affordability problems. It has also been adopted to improve cash flows and effectively handle all risks in the organization. As in alternative medicine, the new methods have been seen as viable options for the improved (financial) health of the organization.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s04_s02_p04">Risk managers began taking and maintaining long-term control of the process. They have been looking for cost, accounting, and tax efficiencies. Thus, in addition to using captives and risk retention groups (discussed in <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch06#baranoff-ch06">Chapter 6 "The Insurance Solution and Institutions"</a> and <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch08#baranoff-ch08">Chapter 8 "Insurance Markets and Regulation"</a>), they have been establishing customized finite risk programs, multiyear, multiline integrated risk programs, and they have been insuring risks that previously were once considered uninsurable. We will first delve into explaining these new-generation products before working on the LOCO case. The explanation of each program includes examples from real companies.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Nontraditional Insurance Products: The New Generation</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s04_s03_p01">New-generation risk-financing programs have emerged in response to the needs of large and complex organizations. These new-generation products blend with an orchestrated structure of self-insurance, captives, conventional insurance, and excess limits for selected individual lines. These more sophisticated methods of financing risk are being driven by a new breed of strategic-thinking risk managers who have an increased knowledge of risk management theory. They come to the table with a good understanding of their company’s exposures and the financial resources available to handle risk. They are seeking risk-handling solutions that will improve efficiency, be cost-effective, and stabilize earnings.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s04_s03_p02">Increasingly, today’s risk managers are practicing a holistic approach to risk management in which all of the corporation’s risks—business, financial, and operational—are being assessed (as noted in <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch06#baranoff-ch06">Chapter 6 "The Insurance Solution and Institutions"</a>). This concept, sometimes referred to as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">integrated risk management</a><span class="glossdef">Coordinated alternative risk-financing approach of identifying, measuring, and monitoring diverse and multiple risks that require effective and rapid response to changing circumstances.</span></span>, is a coordinated alternative risk-financing approach of identifying, measuring, and monitoring diverse and multiple risks that require effective and rapid response to changing circumstances.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn23_010">Lucy Nottingham, “Integrated Risk Management,” <em class="emphasis">Canadian Business Review</em> 23, no. 2 (1996): 26.</span> Nontraditional risk transfer programs, combined with traditional coverages, are being used to meet the needs of this holistic and strategic risk management approach.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn23_011">Carolyn Aldred, “Alternative Financing of Primary Interest: Risk Managers Expected to Become More Familiar with Nontraditional Products,” <em class="emphasis">Business Insurance</em>, September 3, 1997.</span> Two of the nontraditional transfer programs available to risk managers that are covered in this case are integrated risk and finite insurance programs.</p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">What Attracts Corporations to the New Integrated Programs?</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s04_s03_s01_s01_p01">The traditional approach of a tower of monoline coverages, each with a separate policy limit, has not been meeting the needs and operations of many corporations. Companies have been looking to integrated programs that combine lines of coverages in one aggregate policy—generally for a multiyear term. These integrated programs also go by names such as concentric risk and basket aggregates. The features that are attracting corporations to these programs include the following:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s04_s03_s01_s01_l01">
                    <li>Less administration time and cost</li>
                    <li>Less time and cost for negotiations with brokers and underwriters</li>
                    <li>Elimination of the need to build a tower of coverages</li>
                    <li>One loss triggers just one policy</li>
                    <li>Elimination of gaps in coverage (seamless coverage)</li>
                    <li>Elimination of the need to buy separate limits for each type of coverage</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s04_s03_s01_s01_p02">Judy Lindenmayer’s<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn23_012">Judy Lindenmayer was one of the experts contributing to the creation of this video education segment.</span> program for FMR (Fidelity Investments) was one of the earliest integrated programs. She referred to it as concentric risk. She explained how she lowered her cost through the use of an aggregate limit. Under traditional coverage, an insured may be purchasing limits that are $50 million per year, but it is unlikely that there would be a major loss every year; thus, the full limit would not be used. Therefore, there is a waste of large limits in many of the years while the insured continues to pay for them. The solution to the redundancy and the extra cost is “the integrated program, with one aggregate limit over the three-year period. You buy one $50 million limit.” Obviously, this is going to cost the insured less money. Judy Lindenmayer claimed that cost reductions could be as much as 30 or 40 percent.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s04_s03_s01_s01_p03">Norwest, a bank with assets of $71.4 billion and 43,000 staff members in 3,000 locations (in 1997) across the United States, Canada, the Caribbean, Central and South America, and Asia was another company that could provide an example of what attracts corporations to the new concept. Until 1994, Norwest had traditional coverages. Each class of risk had an individual limit of self-insurance, a layer of commercial insurance, and an excess coverage. There were many risks that were not covered by insurance because of lack of availability.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s04_s03_s01_s01_p04">K. C. Kidder, Norwest’s risk manager, established a new integrated risk-financing program for simplicity and efficiency. In addition, she opted for the multiyear integrated approach. Kidder’s other objectives for the major restructuring included the following:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s04_s03_s01_s01_l02">

May, “The Real Thing,” <em class="emphasis">Financial Executive</em> 13, no. 3 (1997): 42.</span> Allison O’Sullivan, Coca-Cola’s director of risk management, was looking for a program that would do the following:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s04_s03_s01_s01_l03">
                    <li>Provide long-term stability</li>
                    <li>Recognize the company’s financial ability to retain risk</li>
                    <li>Create value through attaining the lowest sustainable cost</li>
                    <li>Increase administrative efficiencies</li>
                    <li>Provide relevant coverage enhancements</li>
                    <li>Strengthen market relationships</li>
                    <li>Enhance options for hard-to-insure business risks worldwide</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s04_s03_s01_s01_p06">Another attractive integrated product of limited use is the multitrigger contract. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">multitrigger contract</a><span class="glossdef">Insurance in which coverage is triggered by the occurrence of more than one event happening within the same time period.</span></span> is insurance in which claims are triggered by the occurrence of more than one event happening within the same time period. The time period is defined in the contract and could be periods such as calendar year, fiscal year, season, or even a day. In a traditional single-trigger policy, a claim is based on the occurrence of any one covered loss, such as an earthquake or a fire. In the multitrigger contract, a claim can be made only if two or more covered incidents occur within that defined contract period. This coverage costs less than individual coverages because the probability of the two (or more) losses happening within the contract time period is lower than the probability of a single loss occurring. In the multitrigger policy, the insurer recognizes this lower probability in the pricing of the product. Thus, it would cost more to buy the earthquake insurance on a stand-alone basis than it would cost to buy earthquake insurance contingent on some other event taking place within that contract time period, such as a shift in foreign exchange or a shift in the cost of a key raw material to the client. Insureds who are concerned only with two very bad losses happening at the same time are those who would be interested in a multitrigger program.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s04_s03_s01_s02_p01">Market conditions are contributing to insurers’ responsiveness to risk managers. The insurance industry and brokerage community have created a new concept of bundling risks into one basket, under one limit, for multiple years. David May of J&amp;H Marsh and McLennan, Inc.,<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn23_014">Today, the company name is simply Marsh. During the period of the case, many brokerage houses merged. The large mergers and the decrease in the number of brokerage houses prompted the consolidation of the brokers and agents organizations into the Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers.</span> reported that “many insurance markets have lined up behind this new approach, offering close to $1 billion in capacity.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn23_015">David G. May, “All-in-One Insurance,” <em class="emphasis">Financial Executive</em> 13, no. 3 (1997): 41.</span> The industry provides large capacity for these types of programs. Two observations of their use include the following: (1) the corporations that use them are large with substantial financial strength and (2) the multiyear term of the programs promotes long-term relationships.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s04_s03_s01_s02_p02">The U.S., European, and Bermuda markets all have been actively participating in various program combinations. XL and CIGNA were among the first players when they teamed up to combine property and casualty lines of coverage. The market demanded broader coverage, and the two insurers, in a very short time, have expanded their offerings. Another active player is Swiss Re with its BETA program. AIG, Chubb, and Liberty Mutual are active in the U.S. market.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s04_s03_s01_s02_p03">Most of this capacity is not dependent on reinsurance. Some insurers offer one-stop shopping, while in other cases the structure uses a number of insurers. Coca-Cola’s program, for example, was provided ultimately by several carriers.</p>

FMR took a very conservative approach, with a separate program to protect its mutual funds clients from employees’ dishonesty or mistakes. For the other part of the company, the corporate side, the coverage included consolidated financial institutions bond coverage, which protects the employee benefits plans and protects against employees’ dishonesty. The other coverages were Directors &amp; Officers (D&amp;O), stockbrokers Errors &amp; Omissions (E&amp;O), corporate E&amp;O, E&amp;O liability for charitable gifts, partnership liability, and electronic and computer crime. The corporate program was designed to respond to the risk management needs of the corporate side, which was “on the cutting edge on a lot of things” and therefore less conservative than the mutual funds’ concentric program.</p>

The insured is paying for its own losses through a systematic payment plan over time.

In this example, the insured has implemented a three-year program with a $100 million aggregate coverage limit for the entire period, with annual premium payments of $20 million. Thus, the insured has promised to pay $60 million over the three-year period, as denoted by increasing increments for each year on the graph. Actual risk transfer—that is, the conventional insurance layer of the finit eprogram—exists between the $60 million that the insured pays in and the $100 million limit. Thus, there is $40 million in risk transfer. This risk transfer layer is shown in dark blue on the graph.</p>

But what if losses exceed $20 million in the first year? This is the timing risk that the insurer takes—the risk that losses will exceed the insured’s deposit—in which case, the insurer has to pay for them prior to having received the funds from the insured. The graph shows the timing risk in white. It is the difference between the insured’s accumulated payments into the fund and the total amount the insured promises to pay into the fund over the entire time period (in this example, $60 million over a three-year period). The timing layer is similar to a line of credit for the insured. The insured must still pay the insurer for the losses that were paid out in advance, or “loaned” to the insured.</p>

The finite program is outlined with dotted lines. An important part of its program was the inclusion of risks that are traditionally uninsurable. If a loss occurs under the finite program that is also covered by its underlying integrated coverage, the finite program acts as a layer above the integrated limit. Thus, the finite risk protection is pierced when the integrated limit is exhausted—no deductible is incurred under the finite program. If a loss occurs under the finite program and it is not covered by the integrated program, a $100,000 aggregate deductible applies. Such losses are paid if and when aggregate losses under the finite program reach $100,000.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s04_s03_s02_s07_p01">Finite risk programs offer a number of benefits to corporations:</p>

                    <li>Improves the balance sheet—by including risks for which noninsurance reserves had been established, it allows the company to remove these reserves from its balance sheet.</li>
                    <li>Reduces volatility in earnings—instead of paying unpredictable losses out of current earnings, the insured is paying equal payments to the insurer to cover losses; if losses exceed the payments, the insurer pays them and the insured can work out an arrangement to pay them back up to the agreed-on amount that should be paid into the fund.</li>
                    <li>Allows for profit sharing if the loss experience is favorable—the insured earns interest on the payments that it pays to the insurer. In addition, these payments can be structured as tax deductible, whereas reserves on the balance sheet are not deductible until losses are paid.</li>
                    <li>Helps secure insurance for uninsurable risks—because the losses are paid by the insured, a program can be structured without limitations on what types of risk can be included.</li>
                    <li>Accesses new capacity for catastrophic risks—finite programs can be structured so they are layered over a very large retention level, a captive, or other insurance program, such as integrated risk programs or conventional insurance.</li>

Thus, a corporation looks at its own risk profile to determine the appropriate risks to include in the program. A corporation can do this in one or more of the following ways:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s04_s03_s02_s08_l01">
                    <li>Examine the balance sheet for reserves—reserves are established for risks on which there is no insurance coverage. The size of these reserves reflects the potential impact of the risk.</li>
                    <li>Examine insurance policies for existing exclusions—this exercise reveals important risks that currently are uninsured.</li>
                    <li>Ask senior managers what keeps them awake at night—in addition to potentially identifying previously unidentified risks, the process reveals the firm’s tolerance for risk by determining what is important to senior managers.</li>

                <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s04_s03_s02_s09_p01">Finite risk programs are becoming increasingly popular. But they are not without disadvantages:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s04_s03_s02_s09_l01">
                    <li>Tax and accounting questions—accounting and tax rules say that there must be more than timing and interest rate risk for the insurer in order for the insured’s payments to be tax deductible. The tax code requires that the finite financing arrangement involve real underwriting risk transfer with a reasonable expectation of loss. Transactions that do not meet tax and accounting rules regarding risk transfer will be treated as deposits. The main requirement is that the insurer (or reinsurer) must stand to realize a significant loss from the transaction. Judy Lindenmayer mentions a general rule of thumb that has developed, whereby 10 to 15 percent of the estimated exposure should be transferred to the insurer, and the risk so transferred must have a 10 to 20 percent chance of loss. Actuaries, however, caution against specifying probability thresholds because they do not allow for the differences in frequency and severity of various exposures.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn23_021">“What is ‘Risk Transfer’ in Reinsurance? Comments on Financial Accounting Standard 113,” <em class="emphasis">Contingencies</em>, September/October 1997, 50–53. (Based on a report of the American Academy of Actuaries Committee on Property and Liability Issues.)</span> Evaluation of the risk transfer element is a complex process that requires a complete understanding of the transaction, the details of which are beyond the scope of this course.</li>
                    <li>The premiums should not be construed as a deposit for accounting purposes. The risk transfer element must be verified by outside auditors. It is permissible to base the tax and accounting for the finite program on two different foundations. However, doing so may draw the attention of income tax auditors.</li>
                    <li>Any monies that are returned to the insured at the end of the period constitute taxable income. To avoid a taxable event, the insured can roll the funds over to the next term.</li>
                    <li>Time-consuming and complex to develop—although finite programs can save considerable time once they are in place, they can take up to a year to develop.</li>
                    <li>Frictional costs may be greater than perceived benefits—these costs are estimated to range from 5 to 10 percent. A fee is paid to the insurer, and a federal excise tax applies to premiums paid for programs that are domiciled offshore.</li>
                    <li>Opportunity cost of committed funds—the programs entail large outlays of cash each year of the term. These large outlays, and the fact that they tie up the funds, can overshadow the net cost efficiencies that might have been obtained. Generally, these cash outlays require the involvement of the company’s CFO or other senior manager. Often, the cash outlays form the obstacle to obtaining senior management approval of the program.</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s04_s04_s01_p05">Recently, Dan Button, director of risk management, was appointed director of global risk management, a newly created position to reflect the integration of domestic and international risk management operations. LOCO has a separate operating officer both for its domestic operations and its international operations. Most likely, the separation of operations was the reason that the risk management operations were handled separately as well. Dan and his chief financial officer (CFO), Elaine Matthews, were instrumental in effecting a change. They knew that economies of scale could be realized by consolidating the risk management function on a global basis. Elaine believes in the holistic approach to risk management and involves Dan in the management of all the risks facing the corporation, be they financial, business, or event-type risks that were traditionally under the authority of the risk manager.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s04_s04_s01_p06">LOCO has a rather large amount of reserves on its balance sheet. A considerable portion of the reserves are attributable to the expected E&amp;O losses that were assumed from Kendu Financial Group when it was acquired in 1994. Another big chunk of the reserve amount is attributable to self-insured workers’ compensation losses. LOCO has self-insured its domestic and international workers’ compensation risk since the early 1980s. Even though claims were handled by a third-party administrator, two individuals on Dan’s staff have devoted their full-time work to workers’ compensation issues. Prompted by soft market conditions, Dan decided to insure the risk. He secured Foreign Voluntary Workers’ Compensation coverage for U.S. workers abroad and for foreign nationals, as well as workers’ compensation coverage for the domestic employees. The company has built up fairly significant loss obligations from self-insuring.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch23_s04_s04_s01_p07">LOCO’s business has been changing rapidly over the last several years. It has become more global, more dependent on technology, and more diversified in its operations. This changing risk environment, along with the corporation’s cost-cutting efforts, has compelled Dan to embark on a comprehensive assessment of his risk management department and the corporate risk profile.</p>

                <p class="para" id="baranoff-ch23_s04_s05_s01_p03">In this section you studied integrated risk management and finite risk management programs, two types of alternative risk-financing arrangements:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="baranoff-ch23_s04_s05_s01_l02">
                    <li>Alternative risk-financing arrangements are complex arrangements used by large commercial clients that apply to losses above the primary self-insurance retentions or losses above the primary insurance layer.</li>
                    <li>Alternative risk-financing arrangements are tailored to clients’ diverse needs and blend self-insurance, captives, conventional insurance, and excess limits.</li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="para">Integrated risk management identifies, measures, and monitors multiple business, financial, and operational risks to satisfy holistic risk management objectives.</p>
                        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="baranoff-ch23_s04_s05_s01_l03">
                            <li>An integrated risk program combines lines of insurance coverage into an aggregate, multitrigger contract for a multiyear term for improved efficiency and cost savings.</li>
                            <li>A company’s loss history, predictability of losses, costs of coverage, and risk tolerance influences the determination of coverages to combine in integrated programs.</li>
                            <li>Integrated programs may be structured with one aggregate deductible for the term of the policy or with separate per occurrence deductibles.</li>
                            <li>Savings from integrated risk programs result from premium decreases, customization, comprehensive coverage, more efficient operations, and reduced administrative costs.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p class="para">In a finite risk program, the insured pays for its own losses through premiums placed in an experience fund held by an insurer</p>
                        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="baranoff-ch23_s04_s05_s01_l04">
                            <li>Finite risk programs allow insureds to share in the underwriting profit and investment income that accrues on premiums, if loss experience is favorable.</li>
                            <li>Finite risk programs are associated with multiyear terms, overall aggregate limits, risk transfer elements, and so forth.</li>
                            <li>The insurer assumes timing risk because losses can exceed funds paid to date by the insured, resulting in liability for the insurer.</li>
                            <li>Finite risk programs can be used in conjunction with integrated risk management.</li>
                            <li>Companies suited for finite programs have high retention levels, unique and/or difficult to insure risks, inadequate availability of traditional coverage, and high liquidity.</li>
                            <li>Finite programs can improve the balance sheet, reduce earnings volatility, secure insurance for previously uninsurable risks, and access new capacity for catastrophic risks.</li>
