        <li>What is risk? How is it philosophically different from uncertainty?</li>
        <li>What is asymmetric information? Explain how it leads to market failures in an otherwise perfectly competitive market.</li>
        <li>Explain the difference between moral hazard and adverse selection. Can one exist without the other?</li>
        <li>What externalities are caused in the insurance market by moral hazard and adverse selection? How are they overcome in practice?</li>
        <li>Do risk-averse individuals outnumber risk-seeking ones? Give an intuitive explanation.</li>
        <li>Provide examples that appear to violate expected utility theory and risk aversion.</li>
        <li>Give two examples that tell how the framing of alternatives affects peoples’ choices under uncertainty.</li>
        <li>Suppose you are a personal financial planner managing the portfolio of your mother. In a recession like the one in 2008, there are enormous losses and very few gains to the assets in the portfolio you suggested to your mother. Given the material covered in this chapter, suggest a few marketing strategies to minimize the pain of bad news to your mother.</li>
        <li>Distinguish, through examples, between sunk cost, availability bias, and anchoring effect as reasons for departure from the expected utility paradigm.</li>
        <li>Suppose Yuan Yuan wants to purchase a house for investment purposes. She will rent it out after buying it. She has two choices. Either buy it in an average location where the lifetime rent from the property will be $700,000 with certainty or buy it in an upscale location. However, in the upscale neighborhood there is a 60 percent chance that the lifetime income will equal $1 million and 40 percent chance it will equal only $250,000. If she has a utility function that equals <span class="inlineequation"><math xml:id="baranoff_ch03_s08_m001" display="inline">

</span>, Where would she prefer to buy the house?</li>
        <li>What is the expected value when a six-sided fair die is tossed?</li>
        <li>Suppose Yijia’s utility function is given by LN(W) and her initial wealth is $500,000. If there is a 0.01 percent chance that a liability lawsuit will reduce her wealth to $50,000, how much premium will she be willing to pay to get rid of the risk?</li>
        <li>Your professor of economics tells you, “The additional benefit that a person derives from a given increase of his stock of a thing decreases with every increase in the stock he already has.” What type of risk attitude does such a person have?</li>
        <li>Ms. Frangipani prefers Pepsi to Coke on a rainy day; Coke to Pepsi on a sunny one. On one sunny day at the CNN center in Atlanta, when faced with a choice between Pepsi, Coke, and Lipton iced tea, she decides to have a Pepsi. Should the presence of iced teas in the basket of choices affect her decision? Does she violate principles of utility maximization? If yes, which assumptions does she violate? If not, then argue how her choices are consistent with the utility theory.</li>
        <li>Explain why a risk-averse person will purchase insurance for the following scenario: Lose $20,000 with 5 percent chance or lose $0 with 95 percent probability. The premium for the policy is $1,000.</li>
