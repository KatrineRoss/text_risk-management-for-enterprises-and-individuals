            <p class="para">George and Mary Keys are very excited over the news that they are to be parents. Since their graduation from college three years ago, they have purchased a new house and a new car. They owe $130,000 on the house and $8,000 on the car. Their only life insurance consists of $75,000 of term coverage on George and $50,000 on Mary. This coverage is provided by their employers as an employee benefit. Their personal balance sheet shows a net worth (assets minus liabilities) of $80,000. George is rapidly moving up within his company as special projects engineer. His current annual salary is $60,000. In anticipation of the new arrival, George is considering the purchase of additional life insurance. He feels that he needs at least $500,000 in coverage, but his budget for life insurance is somewhat limited. The couple has decided that Mary will stay at home with the new baby and put her career on hold for ten years or so while this baby and perhaps a later sibling or two are young.</p>

                <li>George indicates to you that his financial situation will change in five years when he receives a one-time payment of approximately $100,000 from his uncle’s estate. In what way would this information affect the type of life insurance you recommend to George?</li>

        <li>Your wealthy Aunt Mabel, age sixty-four, recently talked to you, her life insurance agent, regarding her desire to see that her great-niece has the funds to attend college. Aunt Mabel is in very good health and expects to live for many years to come. She does not know if she should put aside money in certificates of deposit at the bank, buy more insurance on herself, or choose some other plan of action. She simply knows that her great-niece will need at least $80,000 to pay for her college education in ten years. What type of investment and/or insurance program would you recommend for her? Why?</li>
        <li>Clancy knew he could not meet the physical requirements for insurability, so he had his twin brother, Clarence, take the physical examination in his place. A policy was issued, and three years later, Clancy died. The insurance company claims manager learned that Clancy’s twin took the examination in his place and refused to pay the claim. Clancy’s beneficiary sued the company for the proceeds, claiming that the two-year contestable period had expired. Did the company have to pay? Why or why not?</li>

            <p class="para">Betty Bick, age forty, is considering the purchase of a limited-payment participating life insurance policy that would be paid up when she turns sixty. She plans to work until then and does not wish to pay any premiums after she retires, but she definitely wants whole life insurance protection. Betty earns $45,000 per year as a branch manager for a commercial bank. As a single mother she has been unable to accumulate much wealth. At this time, Betty has two dependent children ages ten and fourteen.</p>
