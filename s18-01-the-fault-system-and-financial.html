        <h2 class="title editable block">The Fault System</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch14_s01_s01_p01">An issue debated extensively over the past several decades is whether or not to maintain a fault-based compensation mechanism for automobile accidents. In response to the debate, over half the states have passed mandatory first-party benefits (also known as no-fault) laws. Subject to various limitations, such laws require that insurers compensate insureds for the insureds’ medical expenses, lost wages, replacement service costs, and funeral expenses incurred as a result of an automobile accident; these are collectively referred to as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">personal injury protection (PIP) and medical payments (Med Pay)</a><span class="glossdef">Compensation paid to insureds for medical expenses, lost wages, replacement service costs, and funeral expenses incurred as a result of an automobile accident.</span></span> Under <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">no-fault</a><span class="glossdef">Insurance laws under which benefits are provided by insurers without regard to who caused the accident.</span></span> laws, benefits are provided by insurers without regard to who caused the accident.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch14_s01_s01_p02">Under the no-fault concept, first-party benefits such as PIP are provided without regard to fault as a way to avoid legal battles. If you were involved in a multicar accident where tort law applied, a lawsuit between the parties likely would result. The suit would be an attempt to place blame for the accident, thereby also placing financial responsibility for the losses incurred. Under the no-fault concept, each injured party would receive compensation from his or her own insurance company. There would be no need to expend resources in determining fault. Furthermore, the worry of being hit by someone who does not have automobile liability insurance would be eliminated. You already have a form of limited no-fault insurance in the coverages that compensate for damage to your car (discussed later in the chapter). The no-fault PIP or Med Pay benefits extend first-party coverage to expenses associated with bodily injury.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch14_s01_s01_p03">No-fault automobile laws are not uniform, yet they typically fall into three categories. <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch14_s01_s01_t01">Table 14.3 "State Auto Insurance Laws Governing Liability Coverage (Financial Responsibility Laws), 2009"</a> lists the laws in each state. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Pure no-fault</a><span class="glossdef">Theoretical insurance laws that would pay only specific damages (economic losses, such as medical expenses and lost wages), but these would be unlimited.</span></span> exists only theoretically and would abolish completely the opportunity to litigate over automobile accidents. Only specific damages (economic losses, such as medical expenses and lost wages) would be available under pure no-fault, but these would be unlimited. Michigan’s no-fault law is closer to pure no-fault than are the laws of other no-fault states.</p>

Serious injuries, or those resulting in losses in excess of the dollar-value threshold, permit the injured party to take legal action, including claims for general damages (such as pain and suffering).</p>

When the claim is over this amount (the threshold in Massachusetts, for example, is $2,000), the at-fault system kicks in.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch14_s01_s01_s01_p01">Interest in no-fault grew from the belief that the tort system is slow, erratic in its results, and expensive considering the portion of the premium dollar used to compensate persons injured in automobile crashes.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn14_017">See Jeffrey O’Connell, “No-Fault Auto Insurance: Back by Popular (Market) Demand,” <em class="emphasis">San Diego Law Review</em> 26 (1989). Most studies regarding these aspects of fault-based laws are now old. Emphasis has turned recently to premium levels, as discussed.</span> If the tort system could be bypassed, all the expenses of the process—including costs of defense and plaintiff’s counsel—could be eliminated. This would make more dollars available for compensation at no additional cost to insureds and perhaps even reduce the cost of insurance. Proponents of no-fault assert that enough money is spent on automobile insurance to compensate all crash victims, but that the tort system wastes funds on the question of fault. Therefore, the concept of fault should be abandoned and the funds should be used more effectively. Furthermore, proponents argue that evidence is weak (if it exists at all) that insurance premiums actually reflect loss potentials and therefore work to deter unsafe driving.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch14_s01_s01_s01_p02">Opponents of no-fault argue that it is simply compulsory health insurance with restrictions on tort action. They observe that workers’ compensation was designed to reduce litigation by abandoning employers’ liability but that, in recent times, litigation in that field has been increasing. Opponents of no-fault assert that many people who favor no-fault do so primarily because they expect it will be cheaper than the present system when, in fact, it may cost more. A study by the Rand Corporation explains that opponents to the no-fault system argue that the system will reduce drivers’ incentives to drive carefully, and, in so doing, accident rates will increase.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn14_018">David S.

A typical law requires evidence of financial responsibility when a driver is involved in an accident or is convicted of a specified offense, such as driving while intoxicated. The simplest way to prove such responsibility is to have an auto liability insurance policy with specified limits that meet or exceed the minimum limits set by various state legislatures. The financial responsibility laws in the various states are shown in <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch14_s01_s02_t01">Table 14.4 "Automobile Financial Responsibility/Compulsory Limits by State, 2009"</a>.

The maximum amount the injured party may claim from the fund is usually the same as that established by the state’s financial responsibility law.

Unfortunately, in many such states, only about 80 or 90 percent of the drivers maintain their insurance after licensing.

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
            <p class="para" id="baranoff-ch14_s01_s02_p04">In this section you studied the major features of no-fault compensation systems and financial responsibility laws for automobile accidents:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="baranoff-ch14_s01_s02_l01">
                <li>In the traditional at-fault system, an injured party is compensated by the liability coverage of the at-fault driver.</li>
                <li>Under no-fault laws, benefits are provided by insurers without regard to who caused the accident.</li>
                <li>No-fault takes three forms: pure no-fault, modified no-fault, and add-on plans.</li>
                <li>No-fault is backed by the belief that the tort system is slow and erratic and adds unnecessary expense in determining fault.</li>
                <li>Critics say that no-fault is a form of compulsory health insurance and reduces drivers’ incentives to drive carefully (thereby increasing accidents and premium costs).</li>
                <li>Financial responsibility laws induce motorists to buy auto liability insurance so that victims of their negligence will be compensated.</li>
                <li>State legislatures set minimum limits that must be carried in auto liability insurance.</li>
                <li>Unsatisfied judgment funds assist injured motorists who cannot collect from financially irresponsible liable parties.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="title">Discussion Questions</h3>
            <ol class="orderedlist" id="baranoff-ch14_s01_s02_l02">
                <li>Discuss the forms of automobile no-fault laws presented in this chapter.</li>
                <li>What are the advantages and disadvantages of no-fault laws presented in this chapter?</li>
                <li>Explain the difference between a monetary threshold and a verbal threshold for no-fault laws.</li>
                <li>What is the purpose of financial responsibility laws?</li>
                <li>Automobile financial responsibility laws require you to have some minimum amount of auto liability insurance. If the purpose of liability insurance is to protect you from loss caused by your negligence, why should the law force you to buy it? Do you think this is a decision for you to make? Explain.</li>
