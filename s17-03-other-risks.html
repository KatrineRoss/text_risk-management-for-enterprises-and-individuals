        <h2 class="title editable block">Flood Risk</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch13_s03_s01_p01">Homeowners policies exclude loss caused by flood for two reasons: it is considered catastrophic, and it is due to the problem of adverse selection because only those living in flood-prone areas would buy the coverage. This major gap in coverage can be filled by purchasing a flood insurance policy available through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), a federal program that provides flood insurance to flood-prone communities. Communities must apply to the program so that citizens can become eligible to buy flood insurance policies. In addition, the communities must undertake certain required loss-control activities under a program administered by the Federal Insurance Administration. Flood insurance is required by law in order to get secured financing to buy, build, or improve structures in areas that are designated Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn13_012">Federal Emergency Management Agency, Accessed March 20, 2009, <a class="link" href="http://www.fema.gov/nfip/nfip.htm">http://www.fema.gov/nfip/nfip.htm</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch13_s03_s01_p02">The policy covers losses that result directly from river and stream and coastal and lakeshore flooding. Structures that are covered by flood insurance include most types of walled and roofed buildings that are principally above ground and affixed to a permanent site. The contents of a fully enclosed building are also eligible for coverage; however, flood insurance policies do not automatically provide this coverage. It must be specifically requested. Commercial structures, multiple-family dwellings, and single-family residences are also eligible for coverage.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch13_s03_s01_p03">Flood insurance provides coverage for structures and (if covered) personal property or contents on an actual cash value basis. Flood policies do not offer replacement coverage for contents. If a single-family residence is insured for 80 percent of its replacement cost, damage to the structure will be reimbursed on a replacement cost basis.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch13_s03_s01_p04">Two layers of coverage are available. The first is emergency coverage, available to residents of flood-prone communities as soon as the community enters the program. The rates are partially subsidized by the federal government.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch13_s03_s01_p05">Once a flood rate map is completed, a second, or regular, layer of coverage is available at actual rather than subsidized rates. Insurance under the regular program is available only to communities that have passed required ordinances and have undergone studies by the Army Corps of Engineers.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch13_s03_s01_p06">In September 1994, Congress enacted the National Flood Insurance Reform Act.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-baranoff-fn13_013">Federal Insurance and Mitigation Administration (FIMA) is part of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is under FEMA: <a class="link" href="http://www.fema.gov/nfip/laws.htm">http://www.fema.gov/nfip/laws.htm</a> (accessed  March 20, 2009).</span> One of the major provisions of the act was to provide for a substantial increase in the amount of flood insurance coverage available. However, after Hurricane Katrina and the floods in New Orleans, these limits appeared too low for the total devastating losses. The rates of flood insurance cost and coverage are shown in <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch13_s03_s01_t01">Table 13.9 "National Flood Insurance Cost and Coverage as of May 2008"</a>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch13_s03_s01_p07">The Act also increased the waiting period from five to thirty days before a flood insurance policy is effective. This thirty-day waiting period begins the day after the application for flood insurance is made. This is a measure to reduce potential adverse selection from individuals who may be downriver from rising flood waters. The waiting period does not apply to the initial purchase of flood insurance coverage when the purchase is in connection with the making, increasing, extension, or renewal of a loan.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch13_s03_s01_p27">The National Flood Insurance Reform Act added an optional extension for mitigation insurance to help policyholders rebuild their substantially, repetitively damaged homes and businesses according to the floodplain management code, including their community’s flood proofing and mitigation regulations. This was previously unavailable under the flood insurance policy; however, substantially damaged structures were still required to be rebuilt according to the floodplain management code.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch13_s03_s01_p28">Flood insurance may be required by law, such as under the Federal Housing Authority (FHA), Veterans Affairs (VA), and federally insured bank or savings and loan association mortgage agreements. Under a provision in the National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994, if a lender discovers at any time during the term of a loan that a building is located in a special flood hazard area, the lender must notify the borrower that flood insurance is required. If the borrower fails to respond, the lender must purchase coverage on behalf of the borrower.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch13_s03_s01_p29">Flood insurance can be purchased through any licensed property or casualty insurance agent or from some direct writing insurers. Some insurers actually issue the flood insurance policies, in partnership with the federal government, as a service and convenience for their policyholders. In those instances, the insurer handles the premium billing and collection, policy issuance, and loss adjustment on behalf of the federal government. These insurers are called Write Your Own (WYO) insurers. Another important result of the National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994 involves the availability of Federal Disaster Relief funds following a flood disaster. Individuals who live in communities located in special flood hazard areas that participate in the National Flood Insurance Program and who do not buy flood insurance no longer are eligible for automatic federal disaster aid for property losses suffered as a result of a flood.</p>

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the State of Louisiana are offering the following guidelines to better understand flood and wind-driven rain damage.</p>
                <p class="para" id="baranoff-ch13_s03_s01_s01_p04">The simple definition of a flood is an excess of water on land that is normally dry. The National Flood Insurance Program includes in their definition inland tidal waters; unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters <strong class="emphasis bold">from any source</strong>; collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or similar body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels that result in a flood.</p>
                <p class="para" id="baranoff-ch13_s03_s01_s01_p05">Homeowner, renter and business owner insurance policies <strong class="emphasis bold">DO NOT</strong> cover flooding. Generally, policies will cover wind, rain, hail, <em class="emphasis">wind-driven rain</em>, and lightning damage. A separate flood insurance policy is needed to protect homes, businesses and personal property against flood damage. If a home, business or other residence is in a FEMA-identified high risk flood zone, a separate flood insurance policy should have been required on a mortgage transaction.</p>
                <p class="para" id="baranoff-ch13_s03_s01_s01_p06">Rain, wind-driven rain, and  hail damage are not in the same damage category as floods. Wind-driven rain damage, regardless of the cause, is a covered peril like wind or lightning, which may have caused an opening in which rain has entered and caused water damage to the home or personal property.</p>
                <p class="para" id="baranoff-ch13_s03_s01_s01_p07">If people affected by hurricanes Katrina and/or Rita have suffered both flood and wind-driven rain damage, it should be reported to the flood insurance carrier as well as to the homeowner, tenant, or business owner insurance carrier. It is likely that a separate adjuster will be assigned for each claim. Adjusters should communicate with each other to coordinate information prior to final settlement.</p>

One example of such a claim is a lien filed by an unpaid worker or materials supplier. Another example is a spouse whose signature does not appear on the deed signed by the other spouse when the property was sold. The claim is based on the spouse’s community property interest in the couple’s real property, regardless of who originally paid for it.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch13_s03_s02_p02">If there is a defect in the title to your property, an informed buyer will insist that it be removed (cleared) before the title is acceptable, even though it may have originated many years ago. The clearing process can be time-consuming and expensive. A title insurance policy protects the home buyer against loss caused by a defect in the title that existed at the time the policy was issued. It does not cover defects that come into existence after the policy is issued. The insurer says,</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="baranoff-ch13_s03_s02_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="baranoff-ch13_s03_s02_p03">If anything was wrong with the title to this property at the time this policy was issued, we will defend you and pay for the loss caused when it is discovered, within policy limits.</p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch13_s03_s02_p04">Before making this promise, the insurer attempts to determine if defects exist. If any are found, they are described in the policy and excluded from coverage, or a policy is not issued until they have been removed. A single premium is paid for the policy, and it remains in force indefinitely. As a general rule, it cannot be assigned. When title to the property is transferred, the purchaser must buy his or her own title insurance policy if protection is desired.</p>
