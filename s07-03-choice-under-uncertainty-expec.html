This refers to a construct used to explain the level of satisfaction a person gets when faced with uncertain choices.

</span> Let the preferences be such that the addition to utility one gets out of an additional dollar at lower levels of wealth is always greater than the additional utility of an extra dollar at higher levels of wealth. So, let us say that when a person has zero wealth (no money), then the person has zero utility. Now if the person receives a dollar, his utility jumps to 1 util. If this person is now given an additional dollar, then as per the monotonicity (more-is-better) assumption, his utility will go up. Let us say that it goes up to 1.414 utils so that the increase in utility is only 0.414 utils, while earlier it was a whole unit (1 util). At 2 dollars of wealth, if the individual receives another dollar, then again his families’ utility rises to a new level, but only to 1.732 utils, an increase of 0.318 units (1.732 − 1.414). This is increasing utility at a decreasing rate for each additional unit of wealth. <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch03_s03_s01_f01">Figure 3.2 "A Utility Function for a Risk-Averse Individual"</a> shows a graph of the utility.</p>

The AFP for the game is $4. Suppose that a person named Terry bears this cost upfront and wins; then his final wealth is $10 − $4 + $10 = $16 (original wealth minus the cost of the game, plus the winning of $10), or else it equals $10 − $4 − $2 = $4 (original wealth minus the cost of the game, minus the loss of $2) in case he loses.

</span> Since the utility is higher when Terry doesn’t play the game, we conclude that any individual whose preferences are depicted by <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch03_s03_s01_f01">Figure 3.2 "A Utility Function for a Risk-Averse Individual"</a> will forgo a game of chance if its cost equals AFP. This is an important result for a concave utility function as shown in <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch03_s03_s01_f01">Figure 3.2 "A Utility Function for a Risk-Averse Individual"</a>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s03_s01_p07">Such a person will need incentives to be willing to play the game. It could come as a price reduction for playing the lottery, or as a premium that compensates the individual for risk. If Terry already faces a risk, he will pay an amount greater than the actuarially fair value to reduce or eliminate the risk. Thus, it works both ways—consumers demand a premium above AFP to take on risk. Just so, insurance companies charge individuals premiums for risk transfer via insurances.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s03_s01_p08">An individual—let’s name him Johann—has preferences that are characterized by those shown in <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch03_s03_s01_f01">Figure 3.2 "A Utility Function for a Risk-Averse Individual"</a> (i.e., by a concave or diminishing marginal utility function). Johann is a risk-averse person. We have seen that a risk-averse person refuses to play an actuarially fair game. Such risk aversions also provide a natural incentive for Johann to demand (or, equivalently, pay) a risk premium above AFP to take on (or, equivalently, get rid of) risk. Perhaps you will recall from <a class="xref" href="baranoff-ch01#baranoff-ch01">Chapter 1 "The Nature of Risk: Losses and Opportunities"</a> that introduced a more mathematical measure to the description of risk aversion. In an experimental study, Holt and Laury (2002) find that a majority of their subjects under study made “safe choices,” that is, displayed risk aversion. Since real-life situations can be riskier than laboratory settings, we can safely assume that a majority of people are risk averse most of the time. What about the remainder of the population?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="baranoff-ch03_s03_s01_p09">We know that most of us do not behave as risk-averse people all the time. In the later 1990s, the stock market was considered to be a “bubble,” and many people invested in the stock market despite the preferences they exhibited before this time. At the time, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan introduced the term “irrational exuberance” in a speech given at the American Enterprise Institute. The phrase has become a regular way to describe people’s deviations from normal preferences. Such behavior was also repeated in the early to mid-2000s with a real estate bubble. People without the rational means to buy homes bought them and took “nonconventional risks,” which led to the 2008–2009 financial and credit crisis and major recessions (perhaps even depression) as President Obama took office in January 2009. We can regard external market conditions and the “herd mentality” to be significant contributors to changing rational risk aversion traits.</p>
        <p class="para block" id="baranoff-ch03_s03_s01_p10">An individual may go skydiving, hang gliding, and participate in high-risk-taking behavior. Our question is, can the expected utility theory capture that behavior as well? Indeed it can, and that brings us to risk-seeking behavior and its characterization in E(U) theory. Since risk-seeking behavior exhibits preferences that seem to be the opposite of risk aversion, the mathematical functional representation may likewise show opposite behavior. For a risk-loving person, the utility function will show the shape given in <a class="xref" href="#baranoff-ch03_s03_s01_f02">Figure 3.3 "A Utility Function for a Risk-Seeking Individual"</a>. It shows that the greater the level of wealth of the individual, the higher is the increase in utility when an additional dollar is given to the person. We call this feature of the function, in which utility is always increasing at an increasing rate, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">increasing marginal utility</a><span class="glossdef">Feature of a utility function in which utility is always increasing at an increasing rate.</span></span>.
