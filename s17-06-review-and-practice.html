            <p class="para">Bill has a homeowners policy with form HO-3. His home has a replacement value of $80,000, and the contents are worth $45,000 at replacement cost or $35,000 at actual cash value. He has a detached greenhouse with heat and humidity control that houses his prized collection of exotic flowers. The flowers are valued at $11,000, and the greenhouse would cost $7,500 to replace at today’s prices. His policy has the following coverages:</p>

                <li>A windstorm causes $20,000 in repair cost damages to the house, and subsequent wind-blown rain causes damage to the contents of the house—$18,000 in replacement cost or $11,000 at actual cash value. The greenhouse is a total loss, as are the exotic plants. Debris removal of the greenhouse to satisfy the city’s health laws costs $350, and further debris removal to clear the way for repairs costs another $280. Two maple trees valued at $600 each are blown down, and their removal costs another $400. Bill must move his family to a nearby rental home for two months while repairs are made to the house. Rental costs are $600 per month, utilities at the rental house are $150 more per month, and the mortgage payments of $550 per month continue to be payable. It costs Bill another $80 per month to commute to work and to drive his children to school. The telephone company charges him $50 to change his telephone to the rental unit and back to his home again.</li>
                <li>After Bill and his family return to their home, faulty wiring installed during repair causes a short and a small fire. All the family clothing has to be washed because of smoke damage, at a cost of $1,200. Repair to the walls requires an additional $4,700. What might be the effect of subrogation in this case?</li>

        <li>What is the mortgage clause in the HO-3 policy?</li>
        <li>Ms. Gotcheaux’s home in San Francisco was damaged by an earthquake. The earthquake caused a gas line to explode and a fire broke out, completely destroying the house. Ms. Gotcheaux’s homeowners policy explicitly excludes coverage for any damage caused by earth movement. Nevertheless, she files a claim with her insurer under her HO-3 policy. As Ms. Gotcheaux’s insurer, how would you handle her claim?</li>

            <p class="para">Brenda Joy is an accountant in a small Kansas town. She works out of her home, which has a replacement value of $125,000 and an actual cash value of $105,000. Brenda purchased an HO-3 with the following limits:</p>

            <ol class="orderedlist" id="baranoff-ch13_s06_l03" numeration="loweralpha">
                <li>One of Brenda’s clients sues her for negligent accounting advice. The lawsuit alleges damages of $75,000.</li>
                <li>A friend of Brenda’s visits at Brenda’s home and trips over a stack of books Brenda laid on the floor temporarily. Brenda takes the friend to the hospital, where treatment costs $645.</li>
                <li>Brenda is the star pitcher for the local softball team. Unfortunately, Brenda’s game was off last month and she beaned an opponent. The opponent’s attorney filed a notice of claim against Brenda, asserting damages of $500,000.</li>
                <li>Neighborhood children often run through Brenda’s yard. Recently, a group did just that, with one child falling over a rock hidden in the grass. The child needed stitches and an overnight stay in the hospital. It is not clear if the child’s parents will sue.</li>

        <li>Where are exclusions found in the homeowners insurance policy? List some standard exclusions.</li>
        <li>Lisbeth is a college student living in a dorm. She has a television, DVD player, stereo, and a number of CDs and DVDs. She also has a lot of expensive clothing. Her parents’ homeowners policy provides $120,000 of protection for coverage A. Do you think Lisbeth should get her own policy to cover her personal property?</li>

            <p class="para">As a newly graduated lawyer, Quinn Krueger was able to find a well-paying job and, as a result, could afford a large enough mortgage to buy a nice house. The mortgage company required that Quinn also purchase a homeowners policy, and so Quinn obtained an HO-3 with $95,000 on coverage A (the replacement cost value), $60,000 for coverage C, $100,000 on coverage E, and $2,000 on coverage F. How would Quinn’s insurer react to the following losses? Explain.</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist" id="baranoff-ch13_s06_l04" numeration="loweralpha">
                <li>Coming home late one night, Quinn accidentally drives her car into the corner of her attached garage. Damage to the garage involves repairs of $2,300. The car needs repairs costing $3,200.</li>
                <li>Quinn owns an electric guitar and likes to play it loudly. Neighbors sue Quinn for nuisance, claiming damages of $25,000 (the reduction in the value of their house).</li>
                <li>Heavy snowfall, followed by rapid melting, results in high water levels. Quinn finds herself dealing with an overflow in her basement. It causes $2,700 in damage to personal property and requires repairs of $1,700 to the basement.</li>
                <li>Thieves are not common in Quinn’s neighborhood, but police believe that a group of crafty criminals broke into her house. The break-in damages the doorway, requiring $685 in repairs. The thieves take a Persian rug valued at $8,300, a television worth $500, jewelry assessed at $3,000, a CD player costing $450, and silverware worth $1,200.</li>
