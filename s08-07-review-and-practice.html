        <li>Rinaldo’s is a high-end jeweler with one retail location on Fifth Avenue in New York City. The majority of sales are sophisticated pieces that sell for $5,000 or more and are Rinaldo’s own artistic creations using precious metals and stones. The raw materials are purchased primarily in Africa (gold, platinum, and diamonds) and South America (silver). Owing to a large amount of international marketing efforts, Internet and catalog sales represent over 45 percent of the total $300 million in annual sales revenue. To accommodate his customers, Rinaldo will accept both the U.S. dollar and other foreign currencies as a form of payment. Acting as an enterprise risk manager consultant, create a risk map model to identify Rinaldo’s risks across the four basic categories of business/strategic risk, operational risk, financial risk, and hazard risk.</li>
